	description = [[The MCM library provides a set of objects to make creating mod configurations as easy as possible.

In addition, many MCM components implement useful UI structures that can be used outside the MCMs. These are documented here. For example, you can use [`mwse.mcm.createSlider(someMenu, {...})`](../apis/mwse.mcm.md#mwsemcmcreateslider) to use labeled sliders from the MCM in your custom menu. Be warned, however, that MCM components require the parent element to have the correct formatting to appear. They tend to work best with menus that utilize `widthProportional` and `autoHeight`.]],
