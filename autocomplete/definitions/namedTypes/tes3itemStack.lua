	description = [[Item stack represents all copies of an item with the same id inside an inventory. This complex container holds a relationship between an item, and zero or more associated item datas. The `itemStack.variables` is a list of different itemData for each item in the stack, not a single itemData. Not every item in the stack needs to have associated itemData.

For example, you might have five journeyman lockpicks:

- 3 new ones (25 uses)
- 1 with 23 uses
- 1 with 18 uses

In this example, all of these lockpicks are represented by a single tes3itemStack object. The `stack.count` is 5. The `#stack.variables` is 2, since there are only 2 used lockpicks, with each having different itemData. The count of new lockpicks is equal to `stack.count - #stack.variables`.
