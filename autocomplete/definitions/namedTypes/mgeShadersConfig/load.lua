If the shader has a category annotation, it is inserted into a position that preserves the category ordering. Shaders without a category will be added to the end of the list.

Summary of category sort order:

* scene: Additional objects rendered into the scene.
* atmosphere: Atmosphere effects that render over all objects, such as mist.
* lens: Lens effects such as depth of field.
* sensor: Sensor effects such as bloom.
* tone: Tone mapping and color grading.
* final: Any effects that need to run last.]],
