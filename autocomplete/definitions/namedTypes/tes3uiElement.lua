Elements are very configurable, and have many HTML-like layout features. All layout properties can be set to `nil` to reset them to the default value, which will deactivate any related layout mode.

Elements can have custom data attached using their `Property` key-value store, and specific Elements have specific `element.widget` accessors to control behaviour.]],
