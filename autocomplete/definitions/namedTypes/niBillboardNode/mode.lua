- `0` Always face camera. Local z-axis becomes parallel to the camera. Minimizes rotation difference from the previous frame for smoother motion.
- `1` Rotate about up vector. The object is rotated around its local y-axis so that its z-axis is pointing towards the camera.
- `2` Rigid face camera. Local z-axis becomes parallel to the camera. Does not depend on previous frame.
