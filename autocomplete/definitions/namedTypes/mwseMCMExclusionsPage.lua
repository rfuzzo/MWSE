It is made up of two lists: The righthand list displays objects that are filtered using custom settings. It could be a list of NPCs, weapons, plugins, etc. Clicking on an item in the righthand list will transfer it to the lefthand list and add it to the config table. Each list can be searched using a search bar, and buttons can be added for different filters to appear in the lefthand list.]],
