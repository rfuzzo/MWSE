A substructure of mobile actors that provides information about the current or previous action.

## Properties

### `aiBehaviorState`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">aibehaviorstate</div>

The behavior state. This maps to values in [`tes3.aiBehaviorState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ai-behavior-states/) namespace.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3.aiBehaviorState](../references/ai-behavior-states.md))

***

### `animationAttackState`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">animationattackstate</div>

The actor's animation state. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-states/) namespace.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3.animationState](../references/animation-states.md))

***

### `attackSwing`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">attackswing</div>

When attacking, this value represents how much the weapon has been pulled back. The value ranges from [0.0 - 1.0].

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `blockingState`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">blockingstate</div>

A state index that indicates an actor's blocking state. It is zero when not blocking and non-zero when blocking. A value of 1 indicates a state transition from non-blocking to blocking, while a value of 2 means blocking is active (where the block animation is currently playing and should not be interrupted).

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `currentAnimationGroup`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">currentanimationgroup</div>

Actor's current animation group. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3.animationGroup](../references/animation-groups.md))

***

### `hitTarget`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">hittarget</div>

The actor's attack target. The target will be saved in `hitTarget` field until a new attack is made. Missing an attack will clear `hitTarget` field.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), nil)

***

### `lastBarterHoursPassed`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">lastbarterhourspassed</div>

A 16-bit hourstamp of the last time a merchant's barter gold was at its base level. It is used as a timer for resetting barter gold, which happens on interacting with a merchant at hourstamp `lastBarterHoursPassed + GMST fBarterGoldResetDelay` or later. Barter gold can also reset when a mobile expires.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `nockedProjectile`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">nockedprojectile</div>

The currently nocked projectile the associated actor is using. It is available while charging a projectile attack, before releasing the projectile. This can be modified, but can only be set to nil, which will remove the projectile without consuming ammo.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileProjectile](../types/tes3mobileProjectile.md))

***

### `physicalAttackType`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">physicalattacktype</div>

A number from the [`tes3.physicalAttackType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/physical-attack-types/) enumeration identifying the physical attack type. Can be `tes3.physicalAttackType.slash`, `.chop`, `.thrust`, `.projectile`, `.creature1`, `.creature2`, or `.creature3.`

Proper time to change the attack direction is the [attackStart](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/attackStart/) event. See the example below to see how.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3.physicalAttackType](../references/physical-attack-types.md))

??? example "Example: Changing axe attack direction"

	```lua
	
	-- In this example, we force the attack
	-- direction for axes to always be chop
	
	---@param e attackStartEventData
	local function onAttackStart(e)
		local mobile = e.reference.mobile
		if not mobile then return end
	
		local weapon = mobile.readiedWeapon.object --[[@as tes3weapon]]
	
		if weapon.type == tes3.weaponType.axeOneHand
		or weapon.type == tes3.weaponType.axeTwoHand then
			-- Now actually change the attack direction
			e.attackType = tes3.physicalAttackType.chop
		end
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.attackStart, onAttackStart)

	```

***

### `physicalDamage`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">physicaldamage</div>

When attacking, this is the value of the weapon damage that was rolled. This value takes into account the actor's strength, attack swing and weapon condition, but it doesn't include difficulty nor target's armor. This value is updated on an attack. After the attack this value will still contain the damage rolled. It will be refreshed on a new attack.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `stolenFrom`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">stolenfrom</div>

No description yet available.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3object](../types/tes3object.md))

***

### `target`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">target</div>

The actor's attack target, stored until the actor attacks successfully again. In contrast to `hitTarget`, `target` property isn't cleared on missed attack.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), nil)

***

### `walkDestination`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">walkdestination</div>

If moving to a location, this is the position to be walked to.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3vector3](../types/tes3vector3.md))
