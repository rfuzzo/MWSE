This event is invoked when an item is being repaired. Currently, the event only fires when the player repairs an item.

```lua
--- @param e repairEventData
local function repairCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.repair, repairCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
