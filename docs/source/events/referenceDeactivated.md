This event is triggered when a reference is deactivated because it has been removed from the world, or is no longer in an active cell.

```lua
--- @param e referenceDeactivatedEventData
local function referenceDeactivatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.referenceDeactivated, referenceDeactivatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`reference`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
