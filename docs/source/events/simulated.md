The simulated event occurs after almost all game logic, excluding when the game is paused or in menu mode. This event is intended to allow changes to the scene that will not be overwritten by game logic.

```lua
--- @param e simulatedEventData
local function simulatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.simulated, simulatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
