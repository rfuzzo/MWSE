The key event fires when a key up or key down input is detected. It is preferred that the keyDown and keyUp events are used instead.

```lua
--- @param e keyEventData
local function keyCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.key, keyCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`keyCode`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `isAltDown` (boolean): *Read-only*. True if either alt key is held.
* `isControlDown` (boolean): *Read-only*. True if either control key is held.
* `isShiftDown` (boolean): *Read-only*. True if either shift key is held.
* `isSuperDown` (boolean): *Read-only*. True if super (Windows key) is held.
* `keyCode` ([tes3.scanCode](../references/scan-codes.md)): *Read-only*. The scan code of the key that raised the event. Maps to values in [`tes3.scanCode`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/scan-codes/) table.
* `pressed` (boolean): *Read-only*. True if this is a key down event, false for a key up event.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Show a Message when Ctrl-Z is Pressed"

	Displays a simple message when Z is pressed while control is held.

	```lua
	local function myOnKeyCallback(e)
		if( e.pressed and e.isControlDown ) then
			tes3.messageBox({ message = "You pressed Ctrl-Z, but you can't undo all your mistakes." })
		end
	end
	
	-- Filter by the scan code to get Z key presses only.
	event.register(tes3.event.key, myOnKeyCallback, { filter = tes3.scanCode.z } )

	```
