The combatStart event occurs when combat is about to begin between two actors. This event allows scripts to prevent combat from starting. An actor A can start combat with actor B, which will fire the event. Then the actor B may also start combat with actor A which will trigger the event again.

```lua
--- @param e combatStartEventData
local function combatStartCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.combatStart, combatStartCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `actor` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor who is entering combat.
* `target` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor who combat is being triggered against.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Stop certain actors from initiating combat with the player"

	```lua
	
	---@param actor tes3mobileActor
	local function isPacifistTarget(actor)
		-- Here you can filter if the actor should initiate combat with the player.
		-- ...
	end
	
	--- @param e combatStartEventData
	local function forcedPacifism(e)
		if (e.target == tes3.player and isPacifistTarget(e.actor)) then
			return false
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.combatStart, forcedPacifism)

	```
