This event is triggered when the game is about to play a sound when an item gets added or removed from an inventory. Can be blocked to play custom sound instead.

```lua
--- @param e playItemSoundEventData
local function playItemSoundCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.playItemSound, playItemSoundCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`item`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `item` ([tes3baseObject](../types/tes3baseObject.md)): *Read-only*. The item for which the sound is about to be played.
