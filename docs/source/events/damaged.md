The damaged event triggers after an actor has been damaged.

```lua
--- @param e damagedEventData
local function damagedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.damaged, damagedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `activeMagicEffect` ([tes3activeMagicEffect](../types/tes3activeMagicEffect.md)): *Read-only*. Only valid for elemental shield reactive damage. It is the magic effect of the shield which caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `attacker` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor dealing the damage. Can be `nil`.
* `attackerReference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The attacker mobile's associated reference. Can be `nil`.
* `damage` (number): *Read-only*. The amount of damage done.
* `killingBlow` (boolean): *Read-only*. If true, the damage killed the target.
* `magicEffect` ([tes3effect](../types/tes3effect.md)): *Read-only*. The specific effect that triggered the event. This is equal to accessing `e.magicSourceInstance.effects[effectIndex]`. Only valid if magicSourceInstance is set.
* `magicEffectIndex` (number): *Read-only*. The index of the effect in source's effects list. Only valid if magicSourceInstance is set.
* `magicEffectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](../types/tes3magicEffectInstance.md)): *Read-only*. An instance of the magic effect in the spell that caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `magicSourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](../types/tes3magicSourceInstance.md)): *Read-only*. A `tes3magicSourceInstance` object of a spell that caused damage. Can be `nil`.
* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor that took damage.
* `projectile` ([tes3mobileProjectile](../types/tes3mobileProjectile.md)): *Read-only*. Projectile that dealt the damage. Can be `nil`.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The mobileâ€™s associated reference.
* `source` ([tes3.damageSource](../references/damage-sources.md)): *Read-only*. The origin of damage. These damage sources are present as [`tes3.damageSource`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/damage-sources/) constants. See the example. Damage with `tes3.damageSource.shield` source comes from magic shields. Other sources are self-explanatory.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Notify the player that their arrow/bolt killed their opponent"

	```lua
	
	-- Print a message if player's arrow killed its target
	local function onDamaged(e)
		-- We only care if the player did the damage
		if e.attackerReference ~= tes3.player then
			return
		end
	
		-- Check if the damage was caused by a projectile, but not by a spell, so it must be an arrow or a bolt
		if e.projectile ~= nil and e.magicSourceInstance == nil then
	
			-- Did the damage kill the target?
			if e.killingBlow == true then
				tes3.messageBox("Your arrow felled its target!")
			end
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.damaged, onDamaged)

	```

!!! example "Example: Detect that the player died from drowning"

	```lua
	local function onDamaged(e)
		-- We only care if the player recieved the damage
		if e.reference ~= tes3.player then
			return
		end
	
		-- Does the damage come from drowining?
		if e.source ~= tes3.damageSource.suffocation then
			return
		end
	
		-- Is the player in Mudan Grotto?
