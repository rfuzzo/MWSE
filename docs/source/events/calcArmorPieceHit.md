This event is raised just after determining which armor piece, if any, was hit with an attack. The slots can be modified, to draw focus onto specific armor slots.

The following table is used by default to determine what armor piece is hit:

Roll (1-100) | Slot            | Fallback
------------ | --------------- | ---------------
1-29         | Cuirass         | *None*
30-34        | Shield          | Cuirass
35-39        | Shield          | Left Pauldron
40-49        | Left Pauldron   | *None*
50-59        | Right Pauldron  | *None*
60-69        | Greaves         | *None*
70-79        | Helmet          | *None*
80-89        | Boots           | *None*
90-94        | Right Gauntlet  | Right Bracer
95-100       | Left Gauntlet   | Left Bracer

```lua
--- @param e calcArmorPieceHitEventData
local function calcArmorPieceHitCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcArmorPieceHit, calcArmorPieceHitCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`reference.baseObject`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `attacker` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. A shortcut to the attacker mobile's reference.
* `attackerMobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile who is doing the hitting.
* `fallback` (number): A secondary slot to check for equipment on, if no armor is found using the primary slot.
* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): *Read-only*. The mobile who is being hit.
* `projectile` ([tes3mobileProjectile](../types/tes3mobileProjectile.md), nil): *Read-only*. The projectile used that is hitting the given reference. This is nil for all melee combat.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. A shortcut to the mobile's reference.
