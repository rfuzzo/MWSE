uiPreEvent is triggered through various UI events. This includes scrolling through panes, clicking buttons, selecting icons, or a host of other UI-related activities. This event fires before uiEvent, and has the additional advantage of being able to be blocked.

```lua
--- @param e uiPreEventEventData
local function uiPreEventCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.uiPreEvent, uiPreEventCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`source.id`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
