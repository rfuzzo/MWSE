This event triggers when a magic effect has been removed from an actor. This includes:

 - magic effects that have been resisted or are part of abilities like racial passives and diseases
 - magic effects that are removed when an actor is unloaded

This event doesn't trigger when an effect expires naturally.

```lua
--- @param e magicEffectRemovedEventData
local function magicEffectRemovedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.magicEffectRemoved, magicEffectRemovedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`reference`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `effect` ([tes3effect](../types/tes3effect.md)): *Read-only*. The specific effect that triggered the event. This is equal to `e.source.effects[e.effectIndex]`. Can be `nil`.

* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The reference of the mobile actor the magic effect is removed from.
* `source` ([tes3alchemy](../types/tes3alchemy.md), [tes3enchantment](../types/tes3enchantment.md), [tes3spell](../types/tes3spell.md)): *Read-only*. The magic source that contains the effect.

		if e.mobile == tes3.mobilePlayer then
			-- Get the name of the magic effect that has been removed.
			local effectName = tes3.getMagicEffect(e.effect.id).name
	
			-- Get the name of the spell/enchantment/alchemy this magic effect belongs to.
			local sourceName = e.source.name
	
			-- Show a message containing the effect and spell/enchantment/alchemy names to the player.
