The **weatherCycled** event occurs when region weathers are randomized. This occurs at an interval set by the ini option “Hours Between Weather Changes”. Regions may select the same weather as before, and there will be no transition in this case.

```lua
--- @param e weatherCycledEventData
local function weatherCycledCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.weatherCycled, weatherCycledCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
