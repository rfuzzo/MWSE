This event is fired before an actor's armor rating has been calculated, and can be used to override the armor that the actor is given.

```lua
--- @param e calcArmorRatingEventData
local function calcArmorRatingCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcArmorRating, calcArmorRatingCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`armor`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `armor` ([tes3armor](../types/tes3armor.md)): *Read-only*. The armor piece whose AR is being calculated.
