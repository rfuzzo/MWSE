The **weatherTransitionFinished** event occurs when the currently simulated weather finished transitioning to a new weather.

Weather will continue transitioning in interiors, and may finish while in an interior. The transition may be interrupted at any time by the `weatherChangedImmediate` event, and this finish event will not be triggered.

```lua
--- @param e weatherTransitionFinishedEventData
local function weatherTransitionFinishedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.weatherTransitionFinished, weatherTransitionFinishedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data
