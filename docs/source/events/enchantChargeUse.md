This event is triggered just before an on-strike or on-use enchantment is used by any actor, and also by the UI system to label enchant charges. It allows modification of the charge required to use an enchantment.

```lua
--- @param e enchantChargeUseEventData
local function enchantChargeUseCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.enchantChargeUse, enchantChargeUseCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`caster`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `caster` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The caster of the enchantment.
* `charge` (number): The charge required to cast the enchantment. May be modified.
* `isCast` (boolean): True if the calculation is for a on-strike or on-use action, false if for UI enchant charge display. The type of action is found at `e.source.castType`.
* `item` ([tes3item](../types/tes3item.md)): *Read-only*. Only available when isCast is true. The item used to cast the enchantment.
* `itemData` ([tes3itemData](../types/tes3itemData.md)): *Read-only*. Only available when isCast is true. The item data of the item used to cast the enchantment.
* `source` ([tes3enchantment](../types/tes3enchantment.md)): *Read-only*. The enchantment being used or examined by the UI.
* `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](../types/tes3magicSourceInstance.md), nil): *Read-only*. Only available when isCast is true. The instance object of the magic being cast.

Warning: The sourceInstance may be destroyed immediately if the cast fails due to insufficient charge. Do not keep a long-lived reference to this sourceInstance. If you need to reference it in the future, save the source's `serialNumber` and look it up with `tes3.getMagicSourceInstanceBySerial`.
