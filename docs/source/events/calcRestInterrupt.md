This event is called when the player is about to start resting. The hour and count of creatures can be modified, or disabled. Blocking this event blocks any interrupting spawn.

```lua
--- @param e calcRestInterruptEventData
local function calcRestInterruptCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcRestInterrupt, calcRestInterruptCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
