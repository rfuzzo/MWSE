This event fires when a button on the mouse is released.

```lua
--- @param e mouseButtonUpEventData
local function mouseButtonUpCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.mouseButtonUp, mouseButtonUpCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`button`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
