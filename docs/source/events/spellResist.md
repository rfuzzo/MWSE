This event is used when calculating an actor's magic effect resistance, and allows Lua scripts to override the behavior of magic effect resistance by changing the `resistedPercent` value. This can be used to enable willpower-based resistance checks, provide specific resistances to specific spells, spells that heal instead of harm, and a variety of new mechanics.

```lua
--- @param e spellResistEventData
local function spellResistCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.spellResist, spellResistCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`source`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `caster` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The caster of the spell.
* `effect` ([tes3effect](../types/tes3effect.md)): *Read-only*. The specific effect that triggered the event. This is equal to accessing `e.source.effects[effectIndex]`. This field may not always be available.
* `effectIndex` (number): *Read-only*. The index of the effect in source's effects list.
* `effectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](../types/tes3magicEffectInstance.md)): *Read-only*. The unique instance data of the magic effect.
* `resistAttribute` (number): *Read-only*. The attribute resisted. This is an index into a `tes3mobileActor.effectAttributes`. Note that the index here is 0-based, while Lua is 1-based.
* `resistedPercent` (number): The percent of the spell that has been resisted. This can be modified, but a value outside the range of 0 to 100 does not have consistent effects. For fire damage, for example, a value over 100 causes the spell to heal the target instead of harming them.
* `source` ([tes3alchemy](../types/tes3alchemy.md), [tes3enchantment](../types/tes3enchantment.md), [tes3spell](../types/tes3spell.md)): *Read-only*. The magic source.
* `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](../types/tes3magicSourceInstance.md)): *Read-only*. The unique instance data of the magic source.
* `spellCastChance` (number): *Read-only*. The cast chance of the magic source. This is only available if the `source` is a spell or an enchantment.
* `target` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The target of the spell. For self-targeted spells, this matches caster.
