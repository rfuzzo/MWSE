This event is triggered when any spell is cast successfully; this includes spells cast via scripts. This occurs at the end of the casting animation, just after the magic projectile has been constructed.

```lua
--- @param e spellCastedEventData
local function spellCastedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.spellCasted, spellCastedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`source`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `caster` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The caster of the spell.
* `expGainSchool` (number): Of all the magic effects in the spell, there is a magic school which the caster has the lowest skill at casting. This school determines which skill will gain experience on a successful cast. This school can be altered, or set to nil to remove experience gain, possibly in favour of your own experience calculation.
* `source` ([tes3spell](../types/tes3spell.md)): *Read-only*. The magic source.
* `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](../types/tes3magicSourceInstance.md)): *Read-only*. The unique instance of the magic source.
* `target` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The target of the spell. For self-targeted spells, this matches the caster. Touch spells can also have `target` parameter. On target spells don't have `target` parameter during this event, since it can't have a target until it hits it. Which isn't known when the spell is casted.
