This event is invoked after a UI menu has been created or recreated. This can be useful for when important game subcomponents are destroyed and remade, without the entire UI being activated.

**Supported Elements**: `MenuStat_scroll_pane`

```lua
--- @param e uiRefreshedEventData
local function uiRefreshedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.uiRefreshed, uiRefreshedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`element.name`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `element` ([tes3uiElement](../types/tes3uiElement.md)): *Read-only*. The menu element that was recreated or refreshed. The event is filtered on element.name
