This event is raised when the potential activation target for the player changes.

```lua
--- @param e activationTargetChangedEventData
local function activationTargetChangedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.activationTargetChanged, activationTargetChangedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`current`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `current` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The activation target for the player, should they press the activation key. This can be nil when the player is not looking at an activateable object.
* `previous` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. The previous activation target. If the player picked up or activated the previous target, this value may become nil, as the reference no longer exists after being taken.
