This event fires whenever a keybind is tested by the game. A keybind test is often used to see if a button is pressed, but it can also be done to see if an input was toggled or released. Blocking this event is equivalent to setting the `result` event data to false.

```lua
--- @param e keybindTestedEventData
local function keybindTestedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.keybindTested, keybindTestedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`keybind`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `keybind` ([tes3.keybind](../references/keybinds.md)): *Read-only*. The keybind that was tested. This maps to the `tes3.keybind.*` constants.
* `result` (boolean): The read state of the keybind. If true, the key was pressed/released/toggled as determined by the `transition` event data.
* `transition` ([tes3.keyTransition](../references/key-transitions.md)): *Read-only*. The transition for the keybind that was tested. This is typically `tes3.keyTransition.isDown` but not guaranteed to be. Always be sure to check what transition is being used.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Block Journal Keybind"

	Prevents the journal keybind from ever being registered as pressed.

	```lua
	--- @param e keybindTestedEventData
	local function noJournalMenu(e)
	    -- We only care about checks to see if the key was pressed.
	    if (e.transition ~= tes3.keyTransition.isDown) then
	        return
	    end
	
	    -- If the result was false, we also don't care.
	    if (not e.result) then
	        return
	    end
	
	    -- Set the result to false to make the game think the key wasn't pressed.
	    -- We could also block this event by using `return false`.
	    tes3.messageBox("You aren't allowed to open your journal.")
	    e.result = false
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.keybindTested, noJournalMenu, { filter = tes3.keybind.journal })

	```
