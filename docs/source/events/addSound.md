This event is triggered when a sound is played by the game or when `tes3.playSound()` is called.

```lua
--- @param e addSoundEventData
local function addSoundCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.addSound, addSoundCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`sound`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `flags` (number): *Read-only*. A flag whether the sound is looping or not. 0 means the sound doesn't loop, 1 means the sound loops.
* `isVoiceover` (boolean): A flag whether the sound is a voiced line, which are usually found in the Sound\Vo data folder.
* `pitch` (number): The pitch-shift multiplier. For 22kHz audio (most typical) it can have the range [0.005, 4.5]; for 44kHz audio it can have the range [0.0025, 2.25].
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), nil): The reference which is emiting the sound. Not all sounds are played on a reference, such as (un)reading weapon, book-up, and wind sounds.
* `sound` ([tes3sound](../types/tes3sound.md)): The sound going to be played.
* `volume` (number): The volume of the sound. In range [1, 250].
