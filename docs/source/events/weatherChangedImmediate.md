The weatherChangedImmediate event occurs when the currently simulated weather is changed without transition. This can occur when going from an interior to an exterior in a new region, or while resting. This can interrupt weather transitions, which means the `weatherTransitionFinished` event will not be triggered.

```lua
--- @param e weatherChangedImmediateEventData
local function weatherChangedImmediateCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.weatherChangedImmediate, weatherChangedImmediateCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data
