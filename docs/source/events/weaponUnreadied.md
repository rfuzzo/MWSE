This event is called when a weapon is no longer readied, and pairs with the weaponReadied event. It can be used to reliably tell if a specific weapon is readied for attack. This does not necessarily mean that the animation state has changed for the first time. If an actor equips a weapon while having their hands up to attack with, the event will fire for the new weapon.

```lua
--- @param e weaponUnreadiedEventData
local function weaponUnreadiedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.weaponUnreadied, weaponUnreadiedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
