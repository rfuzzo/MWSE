# Actor Functions

--8<-- "mwse-deprecated.md"


***

## `xActivate`

**Parameters:**

- `reference` **target**: What the reference will try to activate.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This function allows the forced activation of one reference onto another. Unlike the vanilla `Activate` function, this allows variable input and will work even when `OnActivate` hasn't been triggered in the script.

!!! note
	Unlike the vanilla activate function, the reference is the actor that will activate something, rather than the object to activate.

??? example "Force the PC to Activate"
	```
	begin test

	long targetRef
	long pcRef

	; Don't force pickup if we're not sneaking.
	if ( GetPCSneaking == 0 )
		return
	endif

	; Get a reference to what the player is looking at.
	setx targetRef to xGetPCTarget
	if ( targetRef == 0 )
		return
	endif

	; Get a reference to the player, and force them to activate what they are looking at.
	setx pcRef to xGetRef "player"
	pcRef->xActivate targetRef

	end
	```


***

## `xAddSpell`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectID**: The object ID of the spell to add.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla `AddSpell` function that can take variable input.


***

## `xAITravel`

**Parameters:**

- `float` **x**: The position to travel to on the X axis.
- `float` **y**: The position to travel to on the Y axis.
- `float` **z**: The position to travel to on the Z axis.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla AITravel function that can take variable input.


***

## `xDrop`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectID**: The object ID of the item to drop.
- `long` **count**: The number of items to drop.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla Drop function that can take variable input.

!!! note
	`xDrop` N+1 items will leave 1 phantom icon plus N real items in the dropping actors inventory.  `xGetItemCount` will not report the 1 phantom icon.  However, `xRemoveItem` will remove the phantom safely.  So "safe" procedure for `xDrop` seems to be to follow up with `xRemoveItem` of the same count.  Additionally for non-player actors in menumode, exit and re-entry to menumode is needed to refresh the icons and avoid phantom icon interaction that could result in permanent item doubling or CTD.  This also applies to the standard drop function.


***

## `xEquip`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectID**: The object ID of the item to equip.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla Equip function that can take variable input.

***

## `xModService`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **services**: The combined value of services the reference should offer (positive) or refuse (negative).

## `xSetBaseGold`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **gold**:  New value to set the reference's base barter gold to.

**Returned:**

- *None*

Changes the base amount of barter gold assigned to the NPC (or creature). Unfortunately this change won't be saved with the save game so you will need to reset it after each game reload or after the "72-hour bug" affects the merchant.


***

## `xSetGold`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **gold**:  New value to set the reference's current barter gold to.

**Returned:**

- *None*

`xSetGold` changes the current amount of barter gold possessed by the NPC (or creature). This value is stored in save game files so it will survive a game reload.

***

## `xSetLevel`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **level**:  New value to set the reference's level to.

**Returned:**

- *None*

Sets the level of the given reference. This function is a wrapper for `SetLevel`, and suffers from the same display issue: when using this function on the player, the character screen does not update with the new level.


***

## `xSetService`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **services**: The combined value of services the reference should offer.

**Returned:**

- *None*

`xSetService` uses the value parameter to change the NPC to offer the set of services represented by the number. The service number values are used and any old services are ignored.

For example using a value of `8` will make the NPC a bookseller. A value of `131587` (`1+2+512+131072`) is typical for smiths. The values changed by this function are not permanent and may be reset after 72-hours or a game reload.

**Returned:**

- **None**

`xStartCombat` is a wrapper for the original StartCombat to take variables.
