# About

The Morrowind Script Extender makes additional functions available for use in Morrowind scripts, beyond those provided by the game's construction set.

These extra functions allow modders to add features and behavior to scripts that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.

## Installation

Before running Morrowind with MWSE enabled, download these prerequisites:

- [Visual Studio x86 2022 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe). Note that you will need the x86 version, even if you already have the x64 redistributable installed.
- [Morrowind Code Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510/) modifies the game executable, and MWSE assumes you have at least the base patches performed for its own modifications.
- [Morrowind Graphic Extender XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) (MGE XE) allows MWSE to be loaded, and provides additional functionality.

Once these are installed, run MWSE-Update.exe in your Morrowind install folder. MGE XE comes bundled with MWSE's updater to make this process simpler. This updater downloads the [latest automated build from GitHub](https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/releases/tag/build-automatic). These can be downloaded manually if the updater fails.
