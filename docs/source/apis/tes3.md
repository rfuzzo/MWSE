## Functions

### `tes3.addArmorSlot`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addarmorslot, armorslot</div>

Registers a new armor slot. Adds a new place for armor pieces with a matching slot number to equip to.

```lua
local wasAdded = tes3.addArmorSlot({ slot = ..., name = ..., key = ..., weight = ..., scalar = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

	* `name` (string): The human-readable name for the armor slot.
	* `key` (string): *Optional*. The key placed in the `tes3.armorSlot` table. If no key is provided, the name will be used.
	* `weight` (number): *Default*: `0`. A stand-in for the armor base weight value, typically controlled by a GMST (e.g. iHelmWeight).
	* `scalar` (number): *Default*: `0.1`. A multiplier with range 0.0-1.0 that controls how much of an item's armor value applies to a character's overall armor rating. For comparison, standard chest armor uses 0.3, helmets, greaves and pauldrons use 0.1, and gauntlets use 0.05.

**Returns**:

* `wasAdded` (boolean)

***

### `tes3.addClothingSlot`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addclothingslot, clothingslot</div>

Registers a new clothing slot. Adds a new place for clothing pieces with a matching slot number to equip to.

```lua

***

### `tes3.addItem`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">additem, item</div>

Adds an item to a given reference's inventory or mobile's inventory. The `reference` will be cloned if needed.

```lua
local count, item, itemData = tes3.addItem({ reference = ..., item = ..., itemData = ..., soul = ..., count = ..., playSound = ..., showMessage = ..., limit = ..., reevaluateEquipment = ..., equipProjectiles = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): Who to give items to.
	* `item` ([tes3item](../types/tes3item.md), [tes3leveledItem](../types/tes3leveledItem.md), string): The item to add. If a leveled item is passed, it will be resolved and added.
	* `itemData` ([tes3itemData](../types/tes3itemData.md)): *Optional*. The item data for the item. The owner, if set, will be cleared. Note that this may be deleted from memory then ignored if it has no other special information associated with it (i.e., it is fully repaired/charged, has no soul, and contains empty lua data).
	* `soul` ([tes3creature](../types/tes3creature.md), [tes3npc](../types/tes3npc.md)): *Optional*. For creating filled soul gems.
	* `count` (number): *Default*: `1`. The maximum number of items to add.
	* `playSound` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `false`, the up/down sound for the item won't be played. This only applies if `reference` is the player.
	* `showMessage` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, a message box notifying the player will be shown. This only applies if `reference` is the player.
	* `limit` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `false`, items can be placed into containers that shouldn't normally be allowed. This includes organic containers, and containers that are full.
	* `reevaluateEquipment` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, and the item added is armor, clothing, or a weapon, the actor will reevaluate its equipment choices to see if the new item is worth equipping. This does not affect the player.
	* `equipProjectiles` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, and the reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged. This will only work if the GUI is updated.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `false`, the function won't manually resync the player's GUI state. This can result in some optimizations, though [`tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate()`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uiforceplayerinventoryupdate) must manually be called after all inventory updates are finished.

**Returns**:

* `count` (number): The number of items added to the reference.
* `item` ([tes3item](../types/tes3item.md)): The item added. This is usually the `item` parameter passed to the function, but can be something else in the case of leveled items.
* `itemData` ([tes3itemData](../types/tes3itemData.md)): The itemData added. This can be created if the `soul` parameter is used, or if an `itemData` was passed. If the passed `itemData` was deleted, the value will be `nil`.

***

### `tes3.addItemData`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">additemdata, itemdata</div>

Creates itemData on a given `reference`, or `to` a reference's inventory. This can be then used to add custom user data or adjust an item's condition. This will return nil if no item data could be allocated for the item -- for example if the reference doesn't have the item in their inventory or each item of that type already has item data. Calling this function will mark the `reference` or `to` reference as modified.

```lua
local createdData = tes3.addItemData({ reference = ..., toCursor = ..., to = ..., item = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): *Optional*. The reference who will be modified. Use this parameter if you want to add itemData to a reference itself. No other parameters are necessary when this one is used.
	* `toCursor` (boolean): *Optional*. Use this parameter if you want to add itemData to an item on the player's cursor. No other parameters are necessary when this one is used.
	* `to` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): *Optional*. The reference or mobile whose inventory will be modified. Use this parameter if you want to add itemData to an item in a reference's inventory.
	* `item` ([tes3item](../types/tes3item.md), string): *Optional*. The item to create item data for. Only applicable if the `to` parameter is used.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the player or contents menu won't be updated.

**Returns**:

* `createdData` ([tes3itemData](../types/tes3itemData.md))

***

### `tes3.addJournalEntry`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addjournalentry, journalentry</div>

This function creates a new journal entry. It can be called once the world controller is loaded.

The text uses the same HTML-style formatting as books, which has different layout to regular dialogue. Use `<BR>` for line breaks that can span pages instead of `\\n`.

```lua
tes3.addJournalEntry({ text = ..., showMessage = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `text` (string): The text of the new Journal entry.
	* `showMessage` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If this parameter is true, a "Your journal has been updated" message will be displayed.

***

### `tes3.addMagicEffect`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addmagiceffect, magiceffect</div>

This function creates a new custom magic effect. The effect can be scripted through lua. This function should be used inside [`magicEffectsResolved`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/magicEffectsResolved/) event callback.

```lua
local effect = tes3.addMagicEffect({ id = ..., name = ..., magnitudeType = ..., magnitudeTypePlural = ..., baseCost = ..., school = ..., size = ..., sizeCap = ..., speed = ..., description = ..., lighting = ..., icon = ..., particleTexture = ..., castSound = ..., boltSound = ..., hitSound = ..., areaSound = ..., castVFX = ..., boltVFX = ..., hitVFX = ..., areaVFX = ..., allowEnchanting = ..., allowSpellmaking = ..., appliesOnce = ..., canCastSelf = ..., canCastTarget = ..., canCastTouch = ..., casterLinked = ..., hasContinuousVFX = ..., hasNoDuration = ..., hasNoMagnitude = ..., illegalDaedra = ..., isHarmful = ..., nonRecastable = ..., targetsAttributes = ..., targetsSkills = ..., unreflectable = ..., usesNegativeLighting = ..., onTick = ..., onCollision = ... })

```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `item` ([tes3misc](../types/tes3misc.md), string): The item to recognize as a soul gem.

**Returns**:

* `wasAdded` (boolean)

	```lua
	local function onInitialized()
	    tes3.addSoulGem({ item = "misc_dwrv_artifact60" })
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.initialized, onInitialized)

	    end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.filterSoulGemTarget, onFilterSoulGemTarget)
	
	-- calcSoulValue event allows assigning a new soul value to creatures
	-- If the event was triggered for an NPC, it allows assigning a value
	-- thus allowing soul-trapping the actor.

### `tes3.addSpell`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addspell, spell</div>

Adds a spell to an actor's spell list. If the spell is passive, the effects will be applied. At least one of the `actor`, `mobile` or `reference` arguments needs to be passed.

```lua
local wasAdded = tes3.addSpell({ reference = ..., actor = ..., mobile = ..., spell = ..., updateGUI = ..., bypassResistances = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): *Optional*. Who to give the spell to. To manipulate an actor without specifying any particular reference, use `actor` instead.
	* `actor` ([tes3actor](../types/tes3actor.md), string): *Optional*. Who to give the spell to. Providing a base actor can be done before a save has been loaded, but may not correctly update effects for instanced versions of that actor in an active save.
	* `mobile` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): *Optional*. Who to give the spell to. To manipulate an actor without specifying any particular reference, use `actor` instead.
	* `spell` ([tes3spell](../types/tes3spell.md), string): The spell to add.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, the GUI will be updated respecting the adding of the spell. This can be useful to disable when batch-adding many spells. The batch should be ended with [`tes3.updateMagicGUI`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updatemagicgui) to reflect the changes.
	* `bypassResistances` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. Should the resistances be bypassed when applying the spell?

**Returns**:

* `wasAdded` (boolean): True if the spell was successfully added. This can be false if the actor's race or birthsign already contains the spell.

***

### `tes3.addTopic`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">addtopic, topic</div>

### `tes3.applyConstantEffectEquipment`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">applyconstanteffectequipment, constanteffectequipment</div>

Controls the magic activation of equipped constant effect items on actors. The game is not very consistent in the activation on constant effect magic on non-player actors. It will activate them on equipping, and on combat start, but does not do this at other times, like cell change. This function allows control over this part of the magic system. It is designed for non-players, and is not recommend to use on the player.

One of `activate` or `deactivate` must be true. Only constant effects on equipped items are considered. `activate` will start constant effects, which will take effect on the next frame. `deactivate` immediately removes constant effects. Activating or deactivating multiple times will not cause stacking problems.

```lua
tes3.applyConstantEffectEquipment({ reference = ..., activate = ..., deactivate = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): The actor reference.
	* `activate` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Activate constant effects on equipped items.
	* `deactivate` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Deactivate constant effects on equipped items.

### `tes3.applyMagicSource`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">applymagicsource, magicsource</div>

Applies magic effects from a spell, potion, or enchantment on the given actor instantly. You can also apply any custom set of effects, by passing an effects table.

Usage:

- To apply a potion pass a `reference`.
- When applying a spell, the `reference` will be the spell's caster, and the `target` will be the spell's target.
- When using enchantment, you need to pass the `reference`, `target`, and `fromStack`. The charge of the item in the `fromStack` will be used. If that item is out of charge no enchantment will be applied.

```lua
local instance = tes3.applyMagicSource({ reference = ..., source = ..., name = ..., effects = ..., createCopy = ..., fromStack = ..., target = ..., bypassResistances = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

***

### `tes3.calculatePrice`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">calculateprice</div>

Calculates a price, given a merchant and associated trading data. This is useful beyond accessing the object's `.value` field in that it raises the appropriate events to let other mods modify the values.

### `tes3.cast`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cast</div>

Casts a spell from a given reference to a target reference. Touch effects will hit the target at any range, while target effects will create a projectile. By default, the spell always casts successfully and does not consume magicka. By default, an actor casting will stop and perform its cast animation, but the 'instant' flag can start the cast instantly and allows more control over the spell for NPCs.

If the caster is the player, the target parameter is optional; without a target, the player's touch effects will only hit targets in front of them, and target effects will create a projectile in the direction the player is facing.

```lua
local success = tes3.cast({ reference = ..., target = ..., spell = ..., instant = ..., alwaysSucceeds = ..., bypassResistances = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): The caster reference.
	* `target` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): *Optional*. The target reference. Optional only if the caster is the player.
	* `spell` ([tes3spell](../types/tes3spell.md), string): The spell the caster uses.
	* `instant` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, the spell is cast instantly. No animation is performed.
	* `alwaysSucceeds` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If `true`, the spell cannot fail and does not consume magicka. If `false`, it is cast using the actor's spell skill, and requires and takes enough magicka to cast. For NPCs, this only applies if `instant` is `true`.
	* `bypassResistances` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, the spell will bypass the target's resistances. For NPCs, this only applies if `instant` is `true`.

**Returns**:

* `success` (boolean): Returns `true` if the spell was cast successfully. Returns `false` if `instant` is `false` and the player is trying to cast the spell, while being unable to cast spells under normal circumstances.

??? example "Example: This is an example of how to use tes3.cast instead of mwscript.explodeSpell"

	```lua
	-- The following code can be tested in-game by pressing Alt + l or Alt + k
	
	event.register(tes3.event.keyDown, function(e)

Creates an arbitrary and automatically tracked visual effect. The visual effect can be an `object` (VFX objects can be found in the statics section of the constuction set), or a `magicEffectId`. You must specify one of a `reference`, `position`, or `avObject` to attach it to.

Most VFX assignments are persistent, and only expire when their lifespan ends, an associated reference is destroyed, or a given spell serial is retired.

```lua
local vfx = tes3.createVisualEffect({ reference = ..., position = ..., avObject = ..., object = ..., magicEffectId = ..., serial = ..., repeatCount = ..., lifespan = ..., scale = ..., verticalOffset = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Optional*. If provided the VFX will be attached to this reference.
	* `position` ([tes3vector3](../types/tes3vector3.md), number[]): *Optional*. If provided the VFX will be attached relative to a position, and not follow a reference.
	* `avObject` ([niAVObject](../types/niAVObject.md)): *Optional*. If provided the VFX will be attached to this scene object.
	* `object` ([tes3physicalObject](../types/tes3physicalObject.md), string): *Optional*. The physical object to use as the VFX. To use an enchantment-style VFX, supply the magicEffectId parameter instead.
	* `magicEffectId` ([tes3.effect](../references/magic-effects.md)): *Optional*. The magic effect ID to use to create an enchantment-style VFX. This will use most of the same VFX logic, but cannot be applied to a position or specific niAVObject.
	* `serial` (number): *Optional*. An associated tes3magicSourceInstance serial. If a serial is assigned to the VFX, the effect expiring will also remove the VFX. This is not used when creating an enchantment-style VFX.
	* `repeatCount` (number): *Optional*. A repeat count for the VFX. If provided, the key timing for the associated effect will be used, multiplied by this value, to determine the total lifespan of the VFX. This is not used when creating an enchantment-style VFX.
	* `lifespan` (number): *Optional*. The desired lifespan for the VFX. If not provided, the VFX will never expire.
	* `scale` (number): *Default*: `1`. The scale used to resize the given VFX. The default value will match the size used by most magical effect logic. This is not used when creating an enchantment-style VFX.
	* `verticalOffset` (number): *Default*: `0`. This offset will be used to position it above its anchor reference. This is not used when creating an enchantment-style VFX.

**Returns**:

* `vfx` ([tes3vfx](../types/tes3vfx.md)): A handle to the VFX that was created. This can be passed to `tes3.removeVisualEffect` to remove it from the reference.

***

### `tes3.loadAnimation`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">loadanimation</div>

Loads an animation and uses it to override existing animations on an actor. Animation groups present in the file will replace the actor's animation groups. The actor's model must be already loaded into memory to have its animations modified. The overridden animations only persist until the actor is unloaded.

Calling this more than once will remove the previous animation override before loading the new animation. Therefore, if applying animations to the player, you should call this before every playAnimation so that different animation mods can co-exist. For NPCs under your mod's control, you only need to do it when the player enters the cell containing the NPC.

Calling this without a file argument will reset the reference's animations to default.

```lua
tes3.loadAnimation({ reference = ..., file = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), [tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), string): The reference to the actor that is having its animations modified.
	* `file` (string): *Optional*. The specified animation base file that will be loaded. e.g. For an animation composed of files anim.nif, xanim.nif and xanim.kf, you should pass file="anim.nif". The animation target skeleton _must_ match the skeleton of the actor to work. i.e. 3rd person anims for NPCs and tes3.player, 1st person anims for firstPersonReference.

***

### `tes3.loadGame`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">loadgame</div>

* `element` ([tes3uiElement](../types/tes3uiElement.md), nil): The UI menu created for the notification, if any.

??? example "Example: A message box with a callback function"

	This demonstrates how to determine which button was pressed inside callback function.

	```lua
	-- This variable is used to store a function that will be
	-- registered as a callback when a button is pressed inside
	-- our messageBox. The function's body is declared later.
	local onButtonPressed
	
	
	-- This function is registered to execute when U key is pressed.
	local function onKeyPressed()
		tes3.messageBox({
			message = "Do you want a muffin?",
			buttons = { "Yes", "No" },
			showInDialog = false,
			callback = onButtonPressed,
		})
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.keyDown, onKeyPressed, { filter = tes3.scanCode.u })
	
	-- Here we define the body of our function.
	onButtonPressed = function(e)
		-- This corresponds to the first button
		-- of our message, which is "Yes"
		if e.button == 0 then
			tes3.addItem({
				reference = tes3.player,
				item = "ingred_bread_01_UNI3",
			})
		end
	end

	```

### `tes3.modDisposition`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">moddisposition, disposition</div>

Modifies the effective disposition of an NPC, and updates the dialogue UI if visible. The change is clamped so that effective disposition remains within the range 0-100. The change can be either permanent or temporary (limited to a dialogue session).

```lua
tes3.modDisposition({ reference = ..., value = ..., temporary = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), [tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), string)
	* `value` (integer): The change in disposition.
	* `temporary` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. When true, the disposition change will only temporarily modify disposition while the dialogue window is open. Temporary changes have no effect outside dialogue.

***

### `tes3.modStatistic`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">modstatistic, statistic</div>

Modifies a statistic on a given actor. This should be used instead of manually setting values on the game structures, to ensure that events and GUI elements are properly handled. Either skill, attribute, or the statistic's property name must be provided.

```lua
tes3.modStatistic({ reference = ..., attribute = ..., skill = ..., name = ..., base = ..., current = ..., value = ..., limit = ..., limitToBase = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), [tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), string)
	* `attribute` ([tes3.attribute](../references/attributes.md)): *Optional*. The attribute to set. Uses a value from [`tes3.attribute`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/attributes/)

	* `name` (string): *Optional*. The property name of the statistic to set. The names can be taken from the properties of `tes3mobileNPC` or `tes3mobileCreature`. Useful for specifying health, magicka, fatigue or encumbrance.
	* `base` (number): *Optional*. If set, the base value will be modified.
	* `current` (number): *Optional*. If set, the current value will be modified.
	* `value` (number): *Optional*. If set, both the base and current value will be modified.
	* `limit` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If set, the attribute won't rise above 100 or fall below 0.
	* `limitToBase` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If set, the attribute's current value won't rise above its base value. Useful for health, magicka, and fatigue.

??? example "Example: Decrease Health of an Actor"

	In this simple example, the current health of an actor, the player, is decreased by 10. To simulate actual combat damage, you should use tes3mobileActor.applyDamage.

	```lua
	tes3.modStatistic({
		reference = tes3.mobilePlayer,
		name = "health",
		current = -10
	})

	```

??? example "Example: Restore Magicka without Overflowing"

	Magicka is restored without exceeding the magicka pool using the limitToBase flag.

	```lua
	tes3.modStatistic({
		reference = tes3.mobilePlayer,
		name = "magicka",
		current = 20,
		limitToBase = true
	})

	```

***

### `tes3.newGame`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">newgame</div>

```

***

### `tes3.onMainMenu`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">onmainmenu</div>

Returns true if the player is on the main menu, and hasn't loaded a game yet.

```lua
local onMainMenu = tes3.onMainMenu()
```

**Returns**:

* `onMainMenu` (boolean)

***

### `tes3.payMerchant`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">paymerchant</div>

Pays a merchant a specified amount of gold and updates the merchant's "last barter timer". This should be used to simulate paying for services. You may also want to play a trade-related sound of your choice upon successful completion.

If `cost` is positive, then that amount of gold will be removed from the player's inventory and added to the merchant's available barter gold.

If `cost` is negative, then that amount of gold will be added to the player's inventory and removed from the merchant's available barter gold.

```lua
local success = tes3.payMerchant({ merchant = ..., cost = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `merchant` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)): The merchant to pay.
	* `cost` (number): The amount of gold to pay the merchant. If negative, the merchant will pay the player.

**Returns**:

* `success` (boolean): `true` if the transaction completed. `false` if there was not enough gold.

***

### `tes3.persuade`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">persuade</div>

Attempts a persuasion attempt on an actor, potentially adjusting their disposition. Returns true if the attempt was a success.

```lua
local success = tes3.persuade({ actor = ..., index = ..., modifier = ... })

	* `actor` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), [tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), string): The actor to try to persuade.
	* `index` (number): *Optional*. If an index is provided, 0-indexed with the following results: admire, intimidate, taunt, bribe (10), bribe (100), bribe (1000).
	* `modifier` (number): *Optional*. If no index is provided, this is the direct modifier to try. The higher the modifer the higher the chance of a successful persuation, and higher disposition change.

**Returns**:

* `success` (boolean)

***

### `tes3.playAnimation`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">playanimation</div>

Plays a given animation group. Optional flags can be used to define how the group starts.

When 'group' is specified, the actor AI is paused while playing the animation, as if in an idle state. When one or more of 'lower', 'upper', or 'shield' are specified without 'group', the actor AI retains control, and the animations are layered. e.g. `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., upper = tes3.animationGroup.idle3, loopCount = 0}` will play the idle3 animation once (without looping) on the upper body, while the player or NPC is still able to walk around. Using 'upper' defers combat actions until the animation is done. Using 'shield' still allows combat actions.

As a special case, `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., group = 0}` returns control to the AI, as the AI knows that is the actor's neutral idle state.

```lua
tes3.playAnimation({ reference = ..., group = ..., lower = ..., upper = ..., shield = ..., startFlag = ..., loopCount = ..., mesh = ... })

	* `loopCount` (number): *Default*: `-1`. If provided, the animation will repeat its loop section a given number of times. To make an animation play through once, set loopCount = 0. Defaults to infinite looping.
	* `mesh` (string): *Optional*. You can also use [`tes3.loadAnimation`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3loadanimation) to reset loaded animations to default.

***

### `tes3.rayTest`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">raytest</div>

Performs a ray test and returns various information related to the result(s). The ray test works by effectively shooting out a line, starting at `position` and pointing towards `direction`, and then checking to see which objects intersect that line.
	
Here is an overview of how some commonly used parameters will alter how `tes3.rayTest` checks for collisions:
	
1. `root`: Things that aren't a `child` of the specified `root` will be skipped. If `root` is not provided, then nothing will be skipped by this process.
2. `ignore`: Objects in this array will be skipped.
3. `maxDistance`: If specified, only objects within the specified distance will be checked.
4. `findAll`: If `true`, then all intersections will be returned. Otherwise, only the first intersection will be returned.

!!! tip Improving performance of rayTest
	The performance of `tes3.rayTest` depends quite a bit on the parameters the function is called with.
	The following suggestions will help to minimize the performance impact of calls to `tes3.rayTest`.

	1. Set a `maxDistance`.
	2. Filter objects by using the `root` parameter. This will make the algorithm **much** faster, and can make it behave more predictably as well. If you're only checking for interactable objects (containers/actors/plants/etc), use `worldPickRoot`. If you're looing for static, non-interable objects, use `worldObjectRoot`. You could even pass a smaller subset of the scene graph with a different `NiNode` you aquired yourself.
	3. Try to keep a cached copy of the array used for the `ignore` parameter (if possible).
	4. Keep maximum size of objects reasonable, and try to limit triangle counts.


```lua
local result = tes3.rayTest({ position = ..., direction = ..., findAll = ..., maxDistance = ..., ignore = ..., root = ..., useModelBounds = ..., useModelCoordinates = ..., useBackTriangles = ..., observeAppCullFlag = ..., accurateSkinned = ..., sort = ..., returnColor = ..., returnNormal = ..., returnSmoothNormal = ..., returnTexture = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `position` ([tes3vector3](../types/tes3vector3.md), number[]): Position of the ray origin.
	* `direction` ([tes3vector3](../types/tes3vector3.md), number[]): Direction of the ray. Does not have to be unit length.
	* `findAll` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If true, the ray test won't stop after the first result.
	* `maxDistance` (number): *Default*: `0`. The maximum distance that the test will run. If set to `0`, no maximum distance will be used.
	* `ignore` (table&lt;integer, [niNode](../types/niNode.md)|[tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)&gt;): *Optional*. An array of references and/or scene graph nodes to cull from the result(s).
	* `root` ([niNode](../types/niNode.md)): *Default*: `tes3.game.worldRoot`. Node pointer to node scene. Only nodes that are a child of this root will be checked by this function. This option can considerably increase performance if used properly. Common choices for the root node are: [`tes3.game.worldLandscapeRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldLandscapeRoot), [`worldObjectRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldObjectRoot) (for most static objects), and [`worldPickRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldPickRoot) (for containers, NPCs, plants, doors, etc).
	* `useModelBounds` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, model bounds will be tested for intersection. Otherwise triangles will be used. This will result in more accurate collision testing, but will be more computationally expensive. This is rarely needed.
	* `useModelCoordinates` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If true, model coordinates will be used instead of world coordinates. Typically not needed.
	* `useBackTriangles` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Include intersections with back-facing triangles. This essentially makes it possible to intersect with the "back-side" of an object, which could make it possible to return a hit on an object if the `position` parameter is "inside" the object in question.This will result in more accurate collision testing, but will be more computationally expensive. This is rarely needed.
	* `observeAppCullFlag` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. Ignore intersections with culled (hidden) models.
	* `accurateSkinned` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If `true`, skinned objects will be deformed, allowing for more accurate collision checking. This **significantly** slows down the operation, and is rarely needed.
	* `sort` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. Sort results by distance from the specified `position`? Only applicable if `findAll == true`.
	* `returnColor` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Calculate and return the vertex color at intersections?
	* `returnNormal` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Calculate and return the vertex normal at intersections?
	* `returnSmoothNormal` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Use normal interpolation for calculating vertex normals?
	* `returnTexture` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Calculate and return the texture coordinate at intersections?

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niPickRecord](../types/niPickRecord.md), [niPickRecord](../types/niPickRecord.md)[], nil)

??? example "Example: Get Activation Target"

	This example performs a `tes3.rayTest` to match the normal activation target test. Unlike `tes3.getPlayerTarget()` this will return objects not normally available for activation.

	```lua
	local hitResult = tes3.rayTest({ position = tes3.getPlayerEyePosition(), direction = tes3.getPlayerEyeVector() })
	local hitReference = hitResult and hitResult.reference
	if (hitReference == nil) then
		return
	end
	
	tes3.messageBox("The player is looking at a '%s'", hitReference.object.name or hitReference.object.id)

	```

??? example "Example: Get Camera Target"

	See what the player's camera is looking at.

	```lua
	local hitResult = tes3.rayTest({ position = tes3.getCameraPosition(), direction = tes3.getCameraVector() })
	local hitReference = hitResult and hitResult.reference
	if (hitReference == nil) then
		return
	end
	
	tes3.messageBox("The camera is looking at a '%s'", hitReference.object.name or hitReference.object.id)

	```

??? example "Example: Multiple Results"

	This example performs a `tes3.rayTest` and displays all results in the entire ray test, rather than ending at the first object hit.

	```lua
	local results = tes3.rayTest{ position = tes3.getCameraPosition(), direction = tes3.getCameraVector(), findAll = true }
	if results then
		for i, hit in pairs(results) do
			mwse.log("Ray hit #%d: %s", i, hit.reference or "<non-reference>");
		end
	end

	```

??? example "Example: Save `tes3.rayTest` result for use at a later point"

	If you plan to use the results of rayTest, you should make sure it still exists. For example, an object which was in a list of results of rayTest can get unloaded when the player changes cells and become invalid, so it shouldn't be accessed.

	```lua
	local function doMyRayTest()
		-- the result can get invalidated
		local result = tes3.rayTest({
			position = tes3.getPlayerEyePosition(),
			direction = tes3.getPlayerEyeVector(),
			ignore = { tes3.player }
		})
	
		if not result then
			return
		end
	
		local refHandle = tes3.makeSafeObjectHandle(result.reference)
		timer.start({
			type = timer.simulate,
			duration = 20,
			iterations = 1,
			callback = function()
				-- Before using the reference, we need to check that it's still valid.
				-- References get unloaded on cell changes etc.
				if not refHandle:valid() then
					return
				end
				local reference = refHandle:getObject()
				-- Now we can use the `reference` variable safely
				-- ...
			end
		})
	end

	```

??? example "Example: Simulating a Dispel"

	In this example there is a 50 % chance that any Water Breathing magic effects will be removed from the player when he/she is underwater.

	```lua
	local function example(e)
			-- We only care about the player
		if (e.mobile.objectType ~= tes3.objectType.mobilePlayer) then
			return
		end
	
		local cell = tes3.mobilePlayer.cell
	
		if (cell.isInterior and not cell.hasWater) then
			return
		end
	
		local waterLevel = cell.waterLevel
		local headPosition = tes3.mobilePlayer.position.z + tes3.mobilePlayer.height
	
		local underwater = headPosition < waterLevel
	
		if not underwater then return end
	
		-- There is a 50 % chance that any Water Breathing effect will be removed from the player
		tes3.removeEffects({
			reference = tes3.player,
			chance = 50,
			effect = tes3.effect.waterBreathing,
		})
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.initialized, function ()
		event.register(tes3.event.calcMoveSpeed, example)
	end)

	```

***

### `tes3.removeItem`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">removeitem, item</div>

Removes an item from a given reference's inventory. Items without itemData will be removed first. The `reference` will be cloned if needed.

```lua
local removedCount = tes3.removeItem({ reference = ..., item = ..., itemData = ..., count = ..., playSound = ..., reevaluateEquipment = ..., updateGUI = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): Who to remove items from.

	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the function won't manually resync the player's GUI state. This can result in some optimizations, though [`tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate()`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uiforceplayerinventoryupdate) must manually be called after all inventory updates are finished.

**Returns**:

* `removedCount` (number)

```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `reference1` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Optional*. Position of the starting point of the LoS check. For actors, this point is set to position of this reference's head. For other objects the starting point is at the top of its bounding box.
	* `reference2` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Optional*. Position of the ending point of the LoS check. For actors, this point is set to position of this reference's head. For other objects the ending point is at the top of its bounding box.

### `tes3.transferInventory`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">transferinventory</div>

Moves all the items in one reference's inventory to another. Both `to` and `from` objects will be cloned. The function will update the GUI for the `to` and `from` references. This function preserves the `tes3itemData` of the transferred items and handles leveled lists. The function can do either partial or complete transfer. Limiting transfer by capacity only works for containers, other actors can get over-encumbered after this operation.

```lua
local transferred = tes3.transferInventory({ from = ..., to = ..., filter = ..., playSound = ..., limitCapacity = ..., completeTransfer = ..., reevaluateEquipment = ..., equipProjectiles = ..., checkCrime = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `from` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): Who to take items from.
	* `to` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), [tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md), string): Who to give items to.
	* `filter` (fun(item: [tes3item](../types/tes3item.md), itemData: [tes3itemData](../types/tes3itemData.md)): boolean): *Optional*. You can pass a filter function to only transfer certain type of items. The `filter` function is called for each item in the `from`'s inventory. Note that not all the items may have itemData.
	* `playSound` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the up/down sound won't be played.
	* `limitCapacity` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, items can be placed into containers that shouldn't normally be allowed. This includes organic containers and containers that are full. If this argument is set to `true` the whole `from`'s inventory might not fit into the destination inventory. In that case, partial transfer is made.
	* `completeTransfer` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. Use this to disable partial transfers. If `limitCapacity` is set to true, passing `completeTransfer = true` will only transfer the items from one inventory to the other if and only if all the items can fit inside the destination inventory. This argument only works if `limitCapacity` is `true`.
	* `reevaluateEquipment` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, and the if in the transferred items are armor, clothing, or weapon items, the actors will reevaluate their equipment choices to see if the new items are worth equipping. This does not affect the player.
	* `equipProjectiles` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, and the `to` reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged.
	* `checkCrime` (boolean): *Default*: `false`. If true, and the `to` reference is the player, the function will check if the player has access to the `from` reference's inventory. If not, appropriate crime reactions will be triggered.

**Returns**:

* `transferred` (boolean): Returns `true` if at least one item was transferred. If both `limitCapacity` and `completeTransfer` were passed as `true` the function returns `true` if the whole inventory was successfully transferred.

??? example "Example: Transfering target's weapons to the player's inventory"

	```lua
	
	-- Pressing i key while looking at a container, NPC or creature
	-- will transfer the target's weapons to the player.
	
	---@param e keyDownEventData
	local function onKeyDown(e)
		local target = tes3.getPlayerTarget()
		if not target then
			tes3.messageBox("No target!")
			return
		end
	
		tes3.transferInventory({
			from = target,
			to = tes3.player,
			---@param item tes3item
			---@param itemData tes3itemData?
			---@return boolean
			filter = function(item, itemData)
				-- You can use the itemData to filter more specifically
				if item.objectType == tes3.objectType.weapon then
					return true
				end
				return false
			end,
			limitCapacity = false,
		})
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.keyDown, onKeyDown, { filter = tes3.scanCode.i })

	```

***

### `tes3.transferItem`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">transferitem</div>

	* `count` (number): *Default*: `1`. The maximum number of items to transfer.
	* `playSound` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the up/down sound for the item won't be played.
	* `limitCapacity` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, items can be placed into containers that shouldn't normally be allowed. This includes organic containers, and containers that are full.
	* `reevaluateEquipment` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, and the item transferred is armor, clothing, or a weapon, the actors will reevaluate their equipment choices to see if the new item is worth equipping. This does not affect the player.
	* `equipProjectiles` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If true, and the `to` reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged. This will only work if the GUI is updated.
	* `updateGUI` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. If false, the function won't manually resync the player's GUI state. This can result in some optimizations, though [tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uiforceplayerinventoryupdate) or [tes3.updateInventoryGUI](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updateinventorygui) and [tes3.updateMagicGUI](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updatemagicgui) must manually be called after all inventory updates are finished.
