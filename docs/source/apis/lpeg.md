## Functions

### `lpeg.B`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">b</div>

Returns a pattern that matches only if the input string at the current position is preceded by pattern p.
	
Pattern p must match only strings with some fixed length, and it cannot contain captures.

Like the and predicate, this pattern never consumes any input, independently of success or failure.

```lua
local result = lpeg.B(p)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The input pattern.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.C`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">c</div>

Create a simple capture pattern, which captures the substring of the subject that matches pattern p.
	
The captured value is a string. If p has other captures, their values are returned after this one.

```lua
local result = lpeg.C(p)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to capture against.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Carg`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">carg</div>

Create an argument capture.
	
This pattern matches the empty string and produces the value given as the nth extra argument given 
in the call to lpeg.match.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Carg(n)
```

**Parameters**:

* `n` (number): The argument to produce.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cb`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cb</div>

Create a back capture.

This pattern matches the empty string and produces the values produced by the most recent group
capture named name (where name can be any Lua value).

Most recent means the last complete outermost group capture with the given name. A Complete capture
means that the entire pattern corresponding to the capture has matched. An Outermost capture means
that the capture is not inside another complete capture.

In the same way that LPeg does not specify when it evaluates captures, it does not specify whether
it reuses values previously produced by the group or re-evaluates them.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cb(name)
```

**Parameters**:

* `name` (any): The group capture to produce.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cc`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cc</div>

Create a constant capture.

This pattern matches the empty string and produces all given values as its captured values.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cc(...)
```

**Parameters**:

* `...` (any): *Optional*. The values to produce.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cf`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cf</div>

Create a fold capture.
	
If pattern p produces a list of captures C1 C2 ... Cn, this capture will produce the value 
function f(...f(f(C1, C2), C3)..., Cn), that is, it will fold (or accumulate, or reduce) the 
captures from p using function f.

This capture assumes that p should produce at least one capture with at least one value (of any 
type), which becomes the initial value of an accumulator. (If you need a specific initial value, 
you may prefix a constant capture to p.) For each subsequent capture, LPeg calls f with this
accumulator as the first argument and all values produced by the capture as extra arguments; the 
first result from this call becomes the new value for the accumulator. The final value of the 
accumulator becomes the captured value.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cf(p, f)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to fold with f.
* `f` (function): The function to use to fold p.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cg`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cg</div>

Create a group capture.

It groups all values returned by pattern p into a single capture. The group may be anonymous (if no
name is given) or named with the given name (which can be any non-nil Lua value).

An anonymous group serves to join values from several captures into a single capture. A named
group has a different behavior. In most situations, a named group returns no values at all. Its
values are only relevant for a following back capture or when used inside a table capture.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cg(p, name)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to capture with.
* `name` (any): *Optional*. The name of the group.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cmt`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cmt</div>

Create a match-time capture.
	
Unlike all other captures, this one is evaluated immediately when a match occurs (even if it is 
part of a larger pattern that fails later). It forces the immediate evaluation of all its nested
captures and then calls function f.

The given function gets as arguments the entire subject, the current position (after the match of 
pattern p), plus any capture values produced by p.

The first value returned by f defines how the match happens. If the call returns a number, 
the match succeeds and the returned number becomes the new current position. (Assuming a subject s
and current position i, the returned number must be in the range [i, len(s) + 1].) If the call 
returns true, the match succeeds without consuming any input. (So, to return true is equivalent to 
return i.) If the call returns false, nil, or no value, the match fails.

Any extra values returned by f become the values produced by the capture. 

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cmt(p, f)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to capture with.
* `f` (function): The function to call to evaluate matches.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cp`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cp</div>

Create a position capture.
	
It matches the empty string and captures the position in the subject where the match occurs. The 
captured value is a number.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cp()
```

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Cs`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">cs</div>

Create a substitution capture, which captures the substring of the subject that matches pattern p, with substitutions.
	
For any capture inside p with a value, the substring that matched the capture is replaced by the 
capture value (which should be a string). The final captured value is the string resulting from all
replacements.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Cs(p)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to capture with.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.Ct`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">ct</div>

Create a table capture.
	
This capture returns a table with all values from all anonymous captures made by pattern p inside 
this table in successive integer keys, starting at 1. Moreover, for each named capture group 
created by p, the first value of the group is put into the table with the group name as its key. 
The captured value is only the table.

```lua
local result = lpeg.Ct(p)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to capture with.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.locale`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">locale</div>

Return a table with patterns for matching some character classes according to the current locale.
	
The table has fields named alnum, alpha, cntrl, digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space, upper,
and xdigit, each one containing a correspondent pattern. Each pattern matches any single character 
that belongs to its class.

If called with an argument table, then it creates those fields inside the given table and returns 
that table. 

```lua
local result = lpeg.locale(t)
```

**Parameters**:

* `t` (table): *Optional*. The table to update.

**Returns**:

* `result` (table)

***

### `lpeg.match`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">match</div>

Attempt to match the given pattern against the subject string.

If the match succeeds, return the index in the subject of the first character after the match, or
the captured values (if the pattern captured any value).

An optional numeric argument init makes the match start at that position in the subject string. As
usual in Lua libraries, a negative value counts from the end.

Unlike typical pattern-matching functions, match works only in anchored mode; that is, it tries to
match the pattern with a prefix of the given subject string (at position init), not with an
arbitrary substring of the subject. So, if we want to find a pattern anywhere in a string, we must
either write a loop in Lua or write a pattern that matches anywhere. This second approach is easy
and quite efficient; see examples in the full documentation for details.

```lua
local result = lpeg.match(p, subject, init)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The pattern to match.
* `subject` (string): The string to match against.
* `init` (number): *Optional*. Start the match at this position in subject.

**Returns**:

* `result` (any)

??? example "Example: Simple Match"

	Create a pattern that matches a word followed by the end of the string, and use it to match strings.

	```lua
	local lpeg = require("lpeg")
	
	local function onLoaded(e)
	
		-- matches a word followed by end-of-string
		local p = lpeg.R("az")^1 * -1
	
		mwse.log(p:match("hello"))		--> 6
		mwse.log(lpeg.match(p, "hello"))  --> 6
		mwse.log(p:match("1 hello"))	  --> nil
	
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.loaded, onLoaded)

	```

***

### `lpeg.P`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">p</div>

Converts the given value into a proper lpeg pattern.

If the argument is a pattern, it is returned unmodified.

If the argument is a string, it is translated to a pattern that matches the string literally.

If the argument is a non-negative number n, the result is a pattern that matches exactly n
characters.

If the argument is a negative number -n, the result is a pattern that succeeds only if the input
string has less than n characters left: lpeg.P(-n) is equivalent to -lpeg.P(n). See the unary minus
operation in the full documentation for details.

If the argument is a boolean, the result is a pattern that always succeeds or always fails
(according to the boolean value), without consuming any input.

If the argument is a table, it is interpreted as a grammar. See Grammars in the full documentation
for details.

If the argument is a function, returns a pattern equivalent to a match-time capture over the empty
string.

```lua
local result = lpeg.P(value)
```

**Parameters**:

* `value` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md), string, number, boolean, table, function): The value to convert to a pattern.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.R`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">r</div>

Returns a pattern that matches any single character belonging to one of the given ranges.
	
Each range is a string xy of length 2, representing all characters with code between the codes of x and y (both inclusive).

As an example, the pattern lpeg.R("09") matches any digit, and lpeg.R("az", "AZ") matches any ASCII letter.

```lua
local result = lpeg.R(p)
```

**Parameters**:

* `p` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md)): The input pattern.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

??? example "Example: Simple Match"

	Create a pattern using lpeg.R that matches a word followed by the end of the string.

	```lua
	local lpeg = require("lpeg")
	
	local function onLoaded(e)
	
		-- matches a word followed by end-of-string
		local p = lpeg.R("az")^1 * -1
	
		mwse.log(p:match("hello"))		--> 6
		mwse.log(lpeg.match(p, "hello"))  --> 6
		mwse.log(p:match("1 hello"))	  --> nil
	
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.loaded, onLoaded)

	```

***

### `lpeg.S`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">s</div>

Returns a pattern that matches any single character that appears in the given string.
	
As an example, the pattern lpeg.S("+-*/") matches any arithmetic operator.

Note that, if s is a character (that is, a string of length 1), then lpeg.P(s) is equivalent to 
lpeg.S(s) which is equivalent to lpeg.R(s..s). Note also that both lpeg.S("") and lpeg.R() are 
patterns that always fail.

```lua
local result = lpeg.S(s)
```

**Parameters**:

* `s` (string): The input string.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.setmaxstack`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">setmaxstack, maxstack</div>

Set a limit for the size of the backtrack stack used by LPeg to track calls and choices.

The default limit is 400. Most well-written patterns need little backtrack levels and therefore you seldom
need to change this limit; before changing it you should try to rewrite your pattern to avoid the need for 
extra space. Nevertheless, a few useful patterns may overflow. Also, with recursive grammars, subjects with
deep recursion may also need larger limits.

```lua
lpeg.setmaxstack(max)
```

**Parameters**:

* `max` (number): The new stack size.

***

### `lpeg.type`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">type</div>

If the given value is a pattern, return the string "pattern". Otherwise return nil.

```lua
local result = lpeg.type(value)
```

**Parameters**:

* `value` (any): The item to evaulate.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md), nil)

***

### `lpeg.V`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">v</div>

Create a non-terminal (a variable) for a grammar.
	
The created non-terminal refers to the rule indexed by v in the enclosing grammar. See Grammars
in the full documentation for details.

```lua
local result = lpeg.V(v)
```

**Parameters**:

* `v` (string): The index of the desired rule.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([pattern](../types/pattern.md))

***

### `lpeg.version`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">version</div>

Return a string with the running version of lpeg.

```lua
local result = lpeg.version()
```

**Returns**:

* `result` (string)
