It is designed for non-players, and is not recommend to use on the player.
--- 
--- One of `activate` or `deactivate` must be true. Only constant effects on equipped items are considered. `activate` will start constant effects, which will take effect on the next frame. `deactivate` immediately removes constant effects.

--- Plays a given animation group. Optional flags can be used to define how the group starts.
--- 
--- When 'group' is specified, the actor AI is paused while playing the animation, as if in an idle state. When one or more of 'lower', 'upper', or 'shield' are specified without 'group', the actor AI retains control, and the animations are layered. e.g. `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., upper = tes3.animationGroup.idle3, loopCount = 0}` will play the idle3 animation once (without looping) on the upper body, while the player or NPC is still able to walk around. Using 'upper' defers combat actions until the animation is done. Using 'shield' still allows combat actions.
--- 
--- As a special case, `tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., group = 0}` returns control to the AI, as the AI knows that is the actor's neutral idle state.

--- Performs a ray test and returns various information related to the result(s). The ray test works by effectively shooting out a line, starting at `position` and pointing towards `direction`, and then checking to see which objects intersect that line.
--- 	
--- Here is an overview of how some commonly used parameters will alter how `tes3.rayTest` checks for collisions:
--- 	
--- 1. `root`: Things that aren't a `child` of the specified `root` will be skipped. If `root` is not provided, then nothing will be skipped by this process.
--- 2. `ignore`: Objects in this array will be skipped.
--- 3. `maxDistance`: If specified, only objects within the specified distance will be checked.
--- 4. `findAll`: If `true`, then all intersections will be returned. Otherwise, only the first intersection will be returned.
--- 
--- !!! tip Improving performance of rayTest
--- 	The performance of `tes3.rayTest` depends quite a bit on the parameters the function is called with.
--- 	The following suggestions will help to minimize the performance impact of calls to `tes3.rayTest`.
--- 
--- 	1. Set a `maxDistance`.
--- 	2. Filter objects by using the `root` parameter. This will make the algorithm **much** faster, and can make it behave more predictably as well. If you're only checking for interactable objects (containers/actors/plants/etc), use `worldPickRoot`. If you're looing for static, non-interable objects, use `worldObjectRoot`. You could even pass a smaller subset of the scene graph with a different `NiNode` you aquired yourself.
--- 	3. Try to keep a cached copy of the array used for the `ignore` parameter (if possible).
--- 	4. Keep maximum size of objects reasonable, and try to limit triangle counts.

--- `position`: tes3vector3|number[] — Position of the ray origin.
--- 
--- `direction`: tes3vector3|number[] — Direction of the ray. Does not have to be unit length.
--- 
--- `findAll`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the ray test won't stop after the first result.
--- 
--- `maxDistance`: number? — *Default*: `0`. The maximum distance that the test will run. If set to `0`, no maximum distance will be used.
--- 
--- `ignore`: table<integer?, niBSAnimationNode|niBSParticleNode|niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode|tes3reference|nil>|nil — *Optional*. An array of references and/or scene graph nodes to cull from the result(s).
--- 
--- `root`: niBSAnimationNode|niBSParticleNode|niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode|nil — *Default*: `tes3.game.worldRoot`. Node pointer to node scene. Only nodes that are a child of this root will be checked by this function. This option can considerably increase performance if used properly. Common choices for the root node are: [`tes3.game.worldLandscapeRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldLandscapeRoot), [`worldObjectRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldObjectRoot) (for most static objects), and [`worldPickRoot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3game/#worldPickRoot) (for containers, NPCs, plants, doors, etc).
--- 
--- `useModelBounds`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If `true`, model bounds will be tested for intersection. Otherwise triangles will be used. This will result in more accurate collision testing, but will be more computationally expensive. This is rarely needed.

--- `useModelCoordinates`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, model coordinates will be used instead of world coordinates. Typically not needed.
--- 
--- `useBackTriangles`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Include intersections with back-facing triangles. This essentially makes it possible to intersect with the "back-side" of an object, which could make it possible to return a hit on an object if the `position` parameter is "inside" the object in question.This will result in more accurate collision testing, but will be more computationally expensive. This is rarely needed.

--- @field filter nil|fun(item: tes3item, itemData?: tes3itemData): boolean *Optional*. You can pass a filter function to only transfer certain type of items. The `filter` function is called for each item in the `from`'s inventory. Note that not all the items may have itemData.
--- @field playSound boolean? *Default*: `true`. If false, the up/down sound won't be played.
--- @field limitCapacity boolean? *Default*: `true`. If false, items can be placed into containers that shouldn't normally be allowed. This includes organic containers and containers that are full. If this argument is set to `true` the whole `from`'s inventory might not fit into the destination inventory. In that case, partial transfer is made.
--- @field completeTransfer boolean? *Default*: `false`. Use this to disable partial transfers. If `limitCapacity` is set to true, passing `completeTransfer = true` will only transfer the items from one inventory to the other if and only if all the items can fit inside the destination inventory. This argument only works if `limitCapacity` is `true`.
--- @field reevaluateEquipment boolean? *Default*: `true`. If true, and the if in the transferred items are armor, clothing, or weapon items, the actors will reevaluate their equipment choices to see if the new items are worth equipping. This does not affect the player.
--- @field equipProjectiles boolean? *Default*: `true`. If true, and the `to` reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged.
--- @field checkCrime boolean? *Default*: `false`. If true, and the `to` reference is the player, the function will check if the player has access to the `from` reference's inventory. If not, appropriate crime reactions will be triggered.

--- Moves one or more items from one reference to another. Returns the actual amount of items successfully transferred. If transfering more than one item, the items without itemData will be transferred first. Both the `from` and `to` references will be cloned if needed.
--- @param params tes3.transferItem.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `from`: tes3reference|tes3mobileActor|tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|tes3mobilePlayer|string — Who to take items from.

--- `equipProjectiles`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, and the `to` reference has the same projectile already equipped, the stacks will be merged. This will only work if the GUI is updated.
--- 
--- `updateGUI`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If false, the function won't manually resync the player's GUI state. This can result in some optimizations, though [tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uiforceplayerinventoryupdate) or [tes3.updateInventoryGUI](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updateinventorygui) and [tes3.updateMagicGUI](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3updatemagicgui) must manually be called after all inventory updates are finished.
