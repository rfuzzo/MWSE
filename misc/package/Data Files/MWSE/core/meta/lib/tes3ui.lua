--- @meta
--- The tes3ui library provides access to manipulating the game's GUI.
--- @class tes3uilib
tes3ui = {}

--- Sends all text input to the specified element.  Calling this function with a nil argument will release text input and allow keybinds to work. Suppresses most keybinds while active, except the Journal open/close keybind (it's up to the individual menu implementation).
--- 
--- Only one element can have control of input, and there is no automatic restoration of control if one element takes control from another. Be careful of conflicts with other users of this function.
--- @param element tes3uiElement|nil The element to focus, or `nil` to clear focus.
function tes3ui.acquireTextInput(element) end

--- When used in a mouse event, causes the element to capture further mouse events even when the cursor goes outside the element. Setting mouse capture should always be accompanied by releasing it on a complementary event. This is commonly used for dragging, so that it can continue even if the mouse moves slightly outside the element.
--- 
--- The capture is always removed when the element is destroyed. The capture may also be removed when the mouse is released, but this is not reliable, as the engine forgets what to do if there is input from any other controller while the mouse is held down.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uicapturemousedrag).
--- @param capture boolean Turns on mouse capture for the element currently processing a mouse event if true, sending all further mouse events to that element. Turns off capture if false.
function tes3ui.captureMouseDrag(capture) end

--- Creates a simple dialogue choice, as per the `Choice` mwscript function.
--- @param text string The text to display for the choice.
--- @param index number The choice index associated with the given text.
function tes3ui.choice(text, index) end

--- This function closes the book menu.
function tes3ui.closeBookMenu() end

--- Closes the journal menu.
--- @return boolean result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.closeJournal() end

--- This function closes the scroll menu.
function tes3ui.closeScrollMenu() end

--- Creates a help layer menu. Help layer menus include notifications and tooltips that are always above the rest of the interface. The game realizes this using a separate menu root and set of functions.
--- 
--- Note, to create tooltips with the correct behaviour, use tes3ui.createTooltipMenu.
--- 
--- Unlike standard menus, help layer menus are always created with a fixed frame.
--- @param params tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string|number — The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findHelpLayerMenu(id).
--- @return tes3uiElement result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu(params) end

---Table parameter definitions for `tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu`.
--- @class tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu.params
--- @field id string|number The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findHelpLayerMenu(id).

--- Creates a top-level menu.
--- @param params tes3ui.createMenu.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string|number — The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findMenu(id).
--- 
--- `dragFrame`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Constructs a draggable and resizeable frame and background for the menu. It is similar to the stats, inventory, magic and map menus in the standard UI. Its title bar text can be set with the .text property. After construction, position and minimum dimensions should be set.
--- 
--- `fixedFrame`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Constructs a fixed (non-draggable) frame and background for the menu. The layout system should automatically centre and size it to fit whatever is added to the menu. This type of menu is modal by default, preventing interaction with other menus while the menu is active.
--- 
--- `modal`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. Only applies to fixedFrame menus. Modal menus prevent interaction with other menus while the menu is active. This behavior can be disabled with this flag.
--- 
--- `loadable`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If set to false, calls to loadMenuPosition will fail.
--- @return tes3uiElement result No description yet available.

--- @param params tes3ui.createResponseText.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `text`: string — The text to display.
--- 
--- `type`: integer? — *Default*: `2`. The type for the response. Defaults to `choice` responses. If set to `1`, a title will be made. Value of `0` corresponds to the main text, and value of `2` corresponds to red clickable choice text.

--- Creates a tooltip menu, which can be an empty menu, an item tooltip, a skill tooltip, or a spell tooltip. This should be called from within a tooltip event callback. These automatically follow the mouse cursor, and are also destroyed automatically when the mouse leaves the originating element. Creating an item tooltip will invoke the uiObjectTooltip event.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uicreatetooltipmenu).
--- @param params tes3ui.createTooltipMenu.params? This table accepts the following values:

--- @return number scale The UI scale value set from MGE.
function tes3ui.getViewportScale() end

--- Returns both the viewport width and the viewport height. Note that this value is not necessarily the real resolution of the screen. For that value, see the [`same-named function`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3getviewportsize) in the tes3 namespace. To get the scale used, check `getViewportScale`.

--- Causes the tooltip to be redisplayed. This will not use a configured delay. This will not function if the help menu does not currently exist, or if it is not currently visible.
function tes3ui.refreshTooltip() end

--- Registers a UI element name, returning a UI_ID. Once a property is registered, this function always returns the same UI_ID. These UI_IDs are used by the API to locate elements that may not exist (a weak reference), instead of by element name.
--- 
--- The registry namespace is shared between Property and UI_ID. It is advisable to use a namespace prefix to avoid collisions with other mods.
--- @param s string No description yet available.
--- @return integer result No description yet available.

--- Displays the book menu with arbitrary text. Paging is automatically handled. It needs to follow [book text conventions](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/general/books/) as in the Construction Set. In essence, it uses HTML syntax. Important: every book needs to end with a `<BR>` statement to be displayed properly. See [`bookGetText`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/bookGetText/#examples) for an example of properly formatted book text.
--- @param text string No description yet available.
function tes3ui.showBookMenu(text) end

--- This function creates a dialogue message. The message can have three styles. The style `2` makes a selectable text. That way by calling this function multiple time you can create a selection of responses.
--- @param params tes3ui.showDialogueMessage.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `text`: string? — *Default*: ``. The text of the shown message.
--- 
--- `style`: number? — *Default*: `0`. This argument controls the text color of the message. Value `0` makes the message text the same color as the text in the dialogue window. Value `1` makes the text white, and also print a newline after the message. Value `2` turns the message into a selectable text inside the dialogue window. Value `3` looks the same as `1` but there isn't a newline after each message. Value `4` is the same as value `1`. All the other values work as `0`.
--- 
--- `answerIndex`: number? — *Default*: `0`. This number can be used later to identify which response was selected.
function tes3ui.showDialogueMessage(params) end

---Table parameter definitions for `tes3ui.showDialogueMessage`.
--- @class tes3ui.showDialogueMessage.params
--- @field text string? *Default*: ``. The text of the shown message.
