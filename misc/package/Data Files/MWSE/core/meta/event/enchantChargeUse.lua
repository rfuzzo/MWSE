--- @class enchantChargeUseEventData
--- @field claim boolean If set to `true`, any lower-priority event callbacks will be skipped. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field caster tes3reference *Read-only*. The caster of the enchantment.
--- @field charge number The charge required to cast the enchantment. May be modified.
--- @field isCast boolean True if the calculation is for a on-strike or on-use action, false if for UI enchant charge display. The type of action is found at `e.source.castType`.
--- @field item tes3alchemy|tes3apparatus|tes3armor|tes3book|tes3clothing|tes3ingredient|tes3light|tes3lockpick|tes3misc|tes3probe|tes3repairTool|tes3weapon *Read-only*. Only available when isCast is true. The item used to cast the enchantment.

--- Warning: The sourceInstance may be destroyed immediately if the cast fails due to insufficient charge. Do not keep a long-lived reference to this sourceInstance. If you need to reference it in the future, save the source's `serialNumber` and look it up with `tes3.getMagicSourceInstanceBySerial`.
