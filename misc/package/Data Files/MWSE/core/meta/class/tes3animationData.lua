--- A game object which contains information on actor's animations.
--- 
--- Animations are divided into three layers. The layer 0 is the base layer containing all the base animations for every humanoid in the game, including the player (when in third person). These animations come from `base_anim.nif`. Layer 1 is for female animations. Any animations present in `base_anim_female.nif` override their male counterparts for humanoid races. For beast races, layer 1 animations come from `base_anim_kna.nif`. Layer 2 are the custom animations assigned to the actor.
--- @class tes3animationData
--- @field actorNode niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode 
--- @field animationGroups table<tes3.animationGroup, tes3animationGroup> *Read-only*. A table of the animation group objects, indexed by the [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.
--- @field animationGroupSoundgenCounts table<tes3.animationGroup, number> *Read-only*. The number of sound generators for each of the animation groups, indexed by the [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.
--- @field animGroupLayerIndicies table<tes3.animationGroup, tes3.activeBodyPartLayer> *Read-only*. The layer from which each of the actor's animation groups come, indexed by the [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.
--- @field approxRootTravelSpeeds table<tes3.animationGroup, number> *Read-only*. The approximate root node travel speed for each of the animation groups, indexed by the [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.
--- @field blinkMorphEndTime number Blink animation end time for `headMorphTiming`. Timing is specific to the current head model.
--- @field blinkMorphStartTime number Blink animation start time for `headMorphTiming`. Timing is specific to the current head model.
--- @field castSpeed number The animation speed multiplier for the spell casting animation. This is a feature added by MWSE.
--- 
--- It functions slightly differently to the other animation speed multipliers. It is not reset by the AI like the movement and weapon speeds. Therefore, it can be set before a spell is cast, as well as during casting. The speed will affect all further casting by the actor.
--- @field currentAnimGroupLayers number[] *Read-only*. 
--- @field currentAnimGroups number[] *Read-only*. The currently playing [animation group](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/), on each of the [body sections](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-body-sections/).
--- @field currentNodeIndices number[] *Read-only*. 
--- @field currentSoundgenIndices number[] *Read-only*. The index of the currently used sound generator for each of the [body sections](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-body-sections/).
--- @field deltaTime number The time in seconds since the last update.
--- @field flags number 
--- @field hasOverrideAnimations boolean *Read-only*. True if the actor has some custom animations in the override layer. For example, drumming or sitting. These are assigned in the Construction Set or using [tes3.loadAnimation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3loadanimation).
--- @field headGeometry niParticles|niRotatingParticles|niTriShape 
--- @field headMorphTiming number The timing offset of the head morph controller. Used to select either blinking or lipsync animations. Actively updated by the animation system during blinking or voiceovers. Timing is specific to the current head model.
--- @field headNode niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode 
--- @field keyframeLayers tes3animationDataSequenceGroup[] *Read-only*. 
--- @field lipsyncLevel number This value indicates whether the NPC is speaking or not. The table below describes the relationship.
--- 
--- Value      | Behavior
--- ---------- | ---------
---       -1.0 | The NPC isn't speaking.
---  0.0 - 1.0 | The NPC is speaking. The value roughly corresponds to the current loudness of the voiceover line. The `lipsyncLevel` is `0.0` when there is a silent part in the sound file the NPC is currently speaking. Also, the speaking actor's mouth is opened more when the value is higher.
--- 
--- @field loopCounts number[] *Read-only*. 
--- @field manager niKeyframeManager 
--- @field modelRootNode niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode 
--- @field movementSpeed number *Read-only*. The animation speed multiplier of movement animations. This includes walking, running, crouching, swimming, turning, jumping and other movement related animations.
--- @field nextLoopCounts number 
--- @field positionDeltaModelRoot tes3vector3 
--- @field spine1Node niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode 
--- @field spine2Node niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode 
--- @field spineAngle number 
--- @field talkMorphEndTime number Lipsync animation end time for `headMorphTiming`. Timing is specific to the current head model.
--- @field talkMorphStartTime number Lipsync animation start time for `headMorphTiming`. Timing is specific to the current head model.
--- @field timeToNextBlink number The time in seconds until the next blink. It is fixed at 0 while the blink animation plays.
--- @field timings table<tes3.animationBodySection, number> The time in seconds indicating the current position within the animation for each individual body section, indexed by values in the [`tes3.animationBodySection`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-body-sections/) table.
--- @field weaponSpeed number The animation speed multiplier of weapon animations. This includes all weapon related idle, attack, and ready/unready animations.
