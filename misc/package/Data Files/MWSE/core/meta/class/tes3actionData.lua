--- @meta
--- A substructure of mobile actors that provides information about the current or previous action.
--- @class tes3actionData
--- @field aiBehaviorState tes3.aiBehaviorState The behavior state. This maps to values in [`tes3.aiBehaviorState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ai-behavior-states/) namespace.
--- @field animationAttackState tes3.animationState The actor's animation state. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-states/) namespace.
--- @field attackSwing number When attacking, this value represents how much the weapon has been pulled back. The value ranges from [0.0 - 1.0].
--- @field blockingState number A state index that indicates an actor's blocking state. It is zero when not blocking and non-zero when blocking. A value of 1 indicates a state transition from non-blocking to blocking, while a value of 2 means blocking is active (where the block animation is currently playing and should not be interrupted).
--- @field currentAnimationGroup tes3.animationGroup Actor's current animation group. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.
--- @field hitTarget tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|tes3mobilePlayer|nil The actor's attack target. The target will be saved in `hitTarget` field until a new attack is made. Missing an attack will clear `hitTarget` field.
--- @field lastBarterHoursPassed number No description yet available.
--- @field nockedProjectile tes3mobileProjectile|tes3mobileSpellProjectile The currently nocked projectile the associated actor is using. It is available while charging a projectile attack, before releasing the projectile. This can be modified, but can only be set to nil, which will remove the projectile without consuming ammo.
--- @field physicalAttackType tes3.physicalAttackType A number from the [`tes3.physicalAttackType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/physical-attack-types/) enumeration identifying the physical attack type. Can be `tes3.physicalAttackType.slash`, `.chop`, `.thrust`, `.projectile`, `.creature1`, `.creature2`, or `.creature3.`

--- Proper time to change the attack direction is the [attackStart](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/attackStart/) event. See the example below to see how.
--- @field physicalDamage number When attacking, this is the value of the weapon damage that was rolled. This value takes into account the actor's strength, attack swing and weapon condition, but it doesn't include difficulty nor target's armor. This value is updated on an attack. After the attack this value will still contain the damage rolled. It will be refreshed on a new attack.
--- @field stolenFrom tes3activator|tes3alchemy|tes3apparatus|tes3armor|tes3bodyPart|tes3book|tes3clothing|tes3container|tes3containerInstance|tes3creature|tes3creatureInstance|tes3door|tes3enchantment|tes3ingredient|tes3leveledCreature|tes3leveledItem|tes3light|tes3lockpick|tes3misc|tes3npc|tes3npcInstance|tes3probe|tes3reference|tes3repairTool|tes3spell|tes3static|tes3weapon No description yet available.
--- @field target tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|tes3mobilePlayer|nil The actor's attack target, stored until the actor attacks successfully again. In contrast to `hitTarget`, `target` property isn't cleared on missed attack.
--- @field walkDestination tes3vector3 If moving to a location, this is the position to be walked to.
