--- This button allows the player to bind a key combination for use with hotkeys. The binder allows specifying if mouse buttons and scroll wheel bindings are allowed and whether modifier keys Shift, Alt and Ctrl are allowed.
--- 
--- When the player presses the button with current hotkey, a prompt asks them to press a new key (or key combination using Shift, Ctrl or Alt) to bind.
--- 
--- If this KeyBinder is set to only accept keyboard keys, key combos are stored in the following format ([mwseKeyCombo](../types/mwseKeyCombo.md)):
--- 
--- ```lua linenums="1"
--- {
--- 	keyCode = tes3.scanCode.{key},
--- 	isShiftDown = true,
--- 	isAltDown = false,
--- 	isControlDown = false,
--- },
--- ```
--- 
--- On the other hand, if the KeyBinder allows binding mouse keys in addition to keyboard keys, key combos are stored in the following format ([mwseKeyMouseCombo](../types/mwseKeyMouseCombo.md)):
--- 
--- ```lua linenums="1"
--- {
--- 	keyCode = tes3.scanCode.{key},
--- 	isShiftDown = true,
--- 	isAltDown = false,
--- 	isControlDown = false,
--- 	mouseWheel = -1 - down, 1 - up, nil
--- 	mouseButton = number|nil
--- },
--- ```

--- @field allowMouse boolean If true, the keybinder will let the user use mouse buttons and scroll wheel in this keybinder.

--- Creates a new KeyBinder.
--- @param data mwseMCMKeyBinder.new.data? This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `label`: string? — *Optional*. Text shown next to the button.
--- 
--- `description`: string? — *Optional*. If in a [Sidebar Page](../types/mwseMCMSideBarPage.md), the description will be shown on mouseover.
--- 
--- `allowCombinations `: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, the KeyBinder will let the user use modification keys: Shift, Ctrl, and Alt when rebinding.
--- 
--- `allowMouse `: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the KeyBinder will let the user use mouse buttons and scroll wheel in this keybinder. In that case the variable will have [mwseKeyMouseCombo](../types/mwseKeyMouseCombo.md) layout, [mwseKeyCombo](../types/mwseKeyCombo.md) otherwise.
--- 
--- `keybindName`: string? — *Optional*. The keybind name. Shown in the popup menu header. This string is formatted into a localized version of "SET %s KEYBIND.". If none is provided the popup has "SET NEW KEYBIND." as header text.
--- 
--- `leftSide`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, the button will be created on the left and label on the right.
--- 
--- `variable`: mwseMCMConfigVariable|mwseMCMCustomVariable|mwseMCMGlobal|mwseMCMGlobalBoolean|mwseMCMPlayerData|mwseMCMTableVariable|mwseMCMVariable|mwseMCMSettingNewVariable|nil — *Optional*. A variable for this KeyBinder.
--- 
--- `defaultSetting`: mwseKeyCombo|mwseKeyMouseCombo|mwseKeyMouseCombo|nil — *Optional*. If `defaultSetting` wasn't passed in the `variable` table, can be passed here. The new variable will be initialized to this value.
--- 
--- `callback`: nil|fun(self: mwseMCMKeyBinder) — *Optional*. The custom function called when the player interacts with this KeyBinder.
--- 
--- `inGameOnly`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the setting is disabled while the game is on main menu.
--- 
--- `restartRequired`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, updating this Setting will notify the player to restart the game.
--- 
--- `restartRequiredMessage`: string? — *Optional*. The message shown if restartRequired is triggered. The default text is a localized version of: "The game must be restarted before this change will come into effect."
--- 
--- `indent`: integer? — *Default*: `12`. The left padding size in pixels. Only used if the `childIndent` isn't set on the parent component.
--- 
--- `childIndent`: integer? — *Optional*. The left padding size in pixels. Used on all the child components.
--- 
--- `paddingBottom`: integer? — *Default*: `4`. The bottom border size in pixels. Only used if the `childSpacing` is unset on the parent component.
--- 
--- `childSpacing`: integer? — *Optional*. The bottom border size in pixels. Used on all the child components.
--- 
--- `postCreate`: nil|fun(self: mwseMCMKeyBinder) — *Optional*. Can define a custom formatting function to make adjustments to any element saved in `self.elements`.
