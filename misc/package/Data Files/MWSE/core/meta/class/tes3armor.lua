Cuirasses have `armorScalar = 0.3`, helmets, pauldrons, greaves, boots and shields have `0.1`, while gauntlets and bracers have `armorScalar = 0.05`.

--- @field isLeftPart boolean Determines if the armor is the left part of a pair.
--- @field maxCondition number The object's maximum condition.
--- @field mesh string The path to the object's mesh.
--- @field name string The player-facing name for the object.
--- @field parts tes3wearablePart[] *Read-only*. An array-style table of the [`tes3wearablePart`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3wearablePart/) data on the object.
--- @field script tes3script The script that runs on the object.
--- @field slot tes3.armorSlot The slot used by the armor. Maps to [`tes3.armorSlot`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/armor-slots/) namespace.
--- @field slotName string *Read-only*. The name of the slot used by the armor.
--- @field value number The value of the object.
--- @field weight number The weight of the object.
--- @field weightClass tes3.armorWeightClass *Read-only*. The weight class of the armor. This value maps to [`tes3.armorWeightClass`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/armor-weight-classes/) constants.

--- Creates a copy of this object.
--- @param params tes3armor.createCopy.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string? — *Optional*. The new object's ID. If one is not provided, a randomly generated one will be used.
--- 
--- `addToObjectList`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, the object will be added to the data handler. If this is false, the new object may not have a randomly generated ID. Do not use this without knowing the implications.
--- 
--- `sourceless`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the object will be made sourceless, and will not be serialized to the save game. If the object is copied outside of a save game, the object will **always** be sourceless.
--- @return tes3armor newObject No description yet available.
function tes3armor:createCopy(params) end
