--- @meta
--- A container object that has not been cloned. Typically represents the raw information edited in the construction set.
--- @class tes3container : tes3actor, tes3physicalObject, tes3object, tes3baseObject
--- @field capacity number The amount of weight that the container can hold.
--- @field isInstance boolean Always returns false.
--- @field mesh string The path to the object's mesh.
--- @field name string The player-facing name for the object.
--- @field organic boolean Determines if the container's organic flag is enabled. The name of this property comes from the Construction Set. If a container is flagged as organic, no items can be stored inside such containers. In vanilla, those are all plants, mushrooms, and ores. In addition, resupplying guild supply chests are implemented as organic and respawning containers.
--- @field respawns boolean Determines if the container's respawn flag is enabled. Only the organic containers can have respawn flag set.
--- 
--- The global script variable, "MonthsToRespawn" is decremented at the end of each month. If it reaches zero at the first day of next month, it is reset to `iMonthsToRespawn` (GMST) and all respawning containers are refilled.
--- @field script tes3script The script that runs on the object.
tes3container = {}

--- Creates a copy of this object.
--- @param params tes3container.createCopy.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string? — *Optional*. The new object's ID. If one is not provided, a randomly generated one will be used.
--- 
--- `addToObjectList`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, the object will be added to the data handler. If this is false, the new object may not have a randomly generated ID. Do not use this without knowing the implications.
--- 
--- `sourceless`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the object will be made sourceless, and will not be serialized to the save game. If the object is copied outside of a save game, the object will **always** be sourceless.
--- @return tes3container newObject No description yet available.
function tes3container:createCopy(params) end

---Table parameter definitions for `tes3container.createCopy`.
--- @class tes3container.createCopy.params
--- @field id string? *Optional*. The new object's ID. If one is not provided, a randomly generated one will be used.
--- @field addToObjectList boolean? *Default*: `true`. If true, the object will be added to the data handler. If this is false, the new object may not have a randomly generated ID. Do not use this without knowing the implications.
--- @field sourceless boolean? *Default*: `false`. If true, the object will be made sourceless, and will not be serialized to the save game. If the object is copied outside of a save game, the object will **always** be sourceless.
