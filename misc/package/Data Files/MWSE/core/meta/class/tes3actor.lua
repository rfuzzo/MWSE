--- An Actor (not to be confused with a Mobile Actor) is an object that can be cloned and that has an inventory. Creatures, NPCs, and containers are all considered actors.
--- 
--- It is standard for creatures and NPCs to be composed of an actor and a mobile actor, linked together with a reference.
--- @class tes3actor : tes3physicalObject, tes3object, tes3baseObject
--- @field actorFlags number *Read-only*. A number representing the actor flags. Truly a bit field.
--- @field barterGold number Friendly access to actor's barter gold amount.
--- @field blood integer Friendly access to actor's blood type, in [0, 7] range. The available blood types are defined in the Morrowind.ini file, and assigned to the actor via the Construction Set.

--- @field equipment tes3equipmentStack[] *Read-only*. The items currently equipped to the actor.

--- Returns the combined value of all the items worn by the actor.
--- @param params tes3actor.getEquipmentValue.params This table accepts the following values:

--- `useDurability`: boolean? â€” *Default*: `false`. If true, damaged items will have a proportionally lower value.
--- @return number value The value of each equipped item added together.
function tes3actor:getEquipmentValue(params) end

--- @class tes3actor.getEquipmentValue.params
--- @field useDurability boolean? *Default*: `false`. If true, damaged items will have a proportionally lower value.
