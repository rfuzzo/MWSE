--- A class to facilitate printing log messages.
--- A new one can be constructed by simply calling `mwse.Logger.new()`.
--- See the [Quickstart Guide](../guides/logging.md#quickstart)
--- for more information.
--- 
--- @class mwseLogger
--- @field abbreviateHeader boolean If set to `true`, the header portion of all logging messages will be shortened. 
--- For example, suppose the following log message is written on line `20` of the file `My Mod/Skills/Player/Combat/swords.lua`.
--- ```lua
--- log("My message")
--- ```
--- Then the resulting output to MWSE.log would be:
--- ```
--- -- abbreviateHeader == true:
--- [My Mod | s/p/c/swords:20  | D] My message
--- -- abbreviateHeader == false:
--- [My Mod | skills/player/combat/swords.lua:20  | DEBUG] My message
--- ```
--- This does not affect how the "body" of log messages are displayed.
--- @field filepath string The path to the file this `mwseLogger` was created in. This will be relative to the `modDir`.
--- 
--- For example, if this `mwseLogger` was constructed in `mods/My Mod/main.lua`, then the `filepath` will be `main.lua`.
--- @field formatter fun(self: mwseLogger, record: mwseLoggerRecord, ...: string|any|fun(...): ...): string This is an advanced option and should be used with care.
--- It allows specifying a custom formatter, allowing for more fine-tuned control over how log messages are printed.
--- If supplying a formatter, you are responsible for also including the "header" portion of the log.
--- These can be created by calling the `protected` `makeHeader` method.
--- 
--- Some examples can be found in the `logger/formatters.lua` folder of the core library.
--- 
--- @field includeTimestamp boolean If set to `true`, all the logged messages will include a timestamp.
--- @field level mwseLogger.logLevel The current logging level.
--- @field logToConsole boolean If `true`, all the logged messages will also be logged to the in-game console.
--- @field modDir string The directory that your mod lives in. This is relative to `Data Files/MWSE/mods`.
--- @field modName string Name of the mod, also counts as unique id of the logger.
--- @field moduleName any Associates a logger with a particular "module". 
--- The `moduleName` will be printed in logging messages next to the `modName`.
--- What does and does not constitute a "module" is entirely subjective. Use this field as you please. 
--- This can be useful if the `filepath` alone is not enough to distinguish what code is reponsible for issuing a log message.
--- For example, the MWSE dependency management system uses a `moduleName` to alert the user about which mod had a dependency problem.
--- 	
--- @field outputFile string|boolean Determines where logging messages are printed. If `false`, log messages are printed to `MWSE.log`. 
--- If it's a `string`, then logging messages will be printed to `Data Files/MWSE/logs/<log.outputFile>.log`.
--- 
--- Setting this to `true` is the same as writing `log.outputFile = log.modDir`.
mwseLogger = {}

--- Gets a logger associated with a particular `modDir`. You can also filter by `filepath` as well.
--- @param modDir string The directory of mod to retrieve the loggers for. This argument corresponds to the `lua-mod` field of the mod's metadata file.
--- @param filepath string? *Optional*. The filepath to retrieve the logger for. This is relative to `modDir` and corresponds to the `filepath` field of the logger to retrieve.
--- @return mwseLogger|nil logger The logger, if it exists.
function mwseLogger.get(modDir, filepath) end

--- Gets a logger with a specific `modName`. You should use `mwseLogger.get` instead.
--- @deprecated
--- @param modName string The name of the mod to retrieve the logger for.
--- @return mwseLogger|nil logger The logger, if it exists.
function mwseLogger.getLogger(modName) end

--- Gets all the loggers registered to a particular `modDir`.
--- @param modDir string The directory of mod to retrieve the loggers for. This argument corresponds to the `lua-mod` field of the mods metadata file.

--- 
--- `moduleName`: string? — *Optional*. The module this Logger is associated with. This can be useful for distinguishes which parts of your mod produce certain log messages. This will be displayed next to the name of the mod, in parentheses.
--- 
--- `level`: mwseLogger.logLevel|mwseLogger.logLevelString|nil — *Default*: `mwse.logLevel.info`. The logging level for all loggers associated to this mod.
--- 
--- `logToConsole`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Should the output also be written to the in-game console?
--- 
--- `outputFile`: boolean|string|nil — *Default*: `false`. The path of the output file to write log messages in. This path is taken relative to `Data Files/MWSE/logs/`. If not provided, log messages will be written to `MWSE.log`. If `true`, then the `modDir` will be used as the output path.
--- 
--- `includeTimestamp`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. Should timestamps be included in logging messages? The timestamps are relative to the time that the game was launched.
--- 
--- `abbreviateHeader`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Should the headers be abbreviated?
--- 
--- `formatter`: nil|fun(self: Logger, record: mwseLoggerRecord, ...: string|any|fun(...): ...): string — *Optional*. A custom formatter. This lets you customize how your logging messages are formatted. If not provided, the default formatter will be used.
