--- @param vec tes3vector3 No description yet available.
--- @return number result No description yet available.
function tes3vector3:distance(vec) end

--- Calculates the distance to another vector, using the [Chebyshev metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance), which is defined as
--- 
--- 	math.max(math.abs(v1.x - v2.x), math.abs(v1.y - v2.y), math.abs(v1.z - v2.z))
--- 
--- This is useful for ensuring that the x, y, and z coordinates between two vectors are all (independently) within a certain distance from each other.
--- 
--- Here is a geometric description of the difference between the normal distance and the Chebyshev distance for two `tes3vector3`s  `v1` and `v2`:
--- 
--- * If `v1:distance(v2) <= 1`, then `v2` is contained in a sphere around `v1` with radius 1 (i.e. diameter 2).
--- * If `v1:distanceChebyshev(v2) <= 1`, then `v2` is contained within a cube centered around `v1`, where the cube has length 2.

function tes3vector3:distanceChebyshev(vec) end

--- Calculates the distance to another vector, using the [Manhattan (i.e. city block) metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry). 
--- In the two-dimensional case, the Manhattan metric can be thought of 
--- as the distance that two taxis will have to travel if they're following a grid system.
--- The formula for the Manhattan distance is
--- 
--- 	math.abs(v1.x - v2.x) + math.abs(v1.y - v2.y) + math.abs(v1.z - v2.z)
--- 
--- This is useful for checking how far you'd actually have to move if you're only allowed to move along one axis at a time.

---
