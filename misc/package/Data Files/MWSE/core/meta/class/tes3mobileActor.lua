Setting this to lower values than the default increases the impact on performance. The default value for a newly created actor depends on the total amount of all currently active [`tes3aiPlanner`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3aiPlanner), meaning the checks will be executed at different intervals for each actor.

This flag is still set with hand-to-hand even though it doesn't use a model. Setting this to false while a weapon is drawn will normally cause the actor to play its weapon draw animation again.
--- @field weaponReady boolean A flag for if the actor has a weapon ready or being readied (visible and held in the hand). Setting it to true will cause the actor to take out their weapon. Setting it to false will cause the actor to put it away.

Maps to values in [`tes3.physicalAttackType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/physical-attack-types/) namespace. When not specified, it uses a weighted random attack type for NPCs and creatures.
--- @field swing number? *Optional*. The strength of the attack swing, in the range [0 to 1]. When not specified, the attack swing is randomized. This value cannot affect the player swing, as player attacks are driven by input.

--- Fetches the statistic object of a skill with a given index. This is the way to access skills for any type of actor, as creatures have a limited version of the skill system. Note that creatures share a statistic between multiple skills (they only have combat, magic, and stealth stats), so many values will be the same.

--- Returns the angle between provided point in space and the actor's current position with provided facing (which effectively overrides the actor's facing used in other getViewTo methods). The returned angle is in degress in range [-180, 180], where 0 degrees is directly in front of the provided facing angle with the origin in actor's position.

--- Induces hit stun on the actor. Without any parameters, it produces a brief stun that lasts about 1 second and prevents starting a new attack. It can produce other types of stun, see parameters. There are states where actors can't be stunned (such as already being in hit stun and paralysis). The function will return if the stun was successfuly applied.
--- @param params tes3mobileActor.hitStun.params? This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `knockDown`: boolean? — *Optional*. Changes the stun type to knockdown. This is when the character falls to their knees and takes several seconds to recover. It will interrupt spell casting.

--- Resurrects the actor, with more control over the resurrect logic compared to mwscript.
--- @param params tes3mobileActor.resurrect.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `resetState`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. Controls if the stats are reset, the inventory contents are respawned, and the reference recreated. This is the logic that mwscript resurrect uses. It can be useful to reset armor, ammunition, and consumables, if the player has already looted the body. When false, the base stats and inventory are unchanged.
--- 
--- `moveToStartingLocation`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Controls if the actor should be moved to its spawn point on resurrection. Requires `resetState` to be true.
