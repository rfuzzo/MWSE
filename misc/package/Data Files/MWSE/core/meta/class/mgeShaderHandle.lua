--- @meta
--- A loaded MGE shader.
--- @class mgeShaderHandle
--- @field enabled boolean The enabled state of the shader.
--- @field name string The shader name.
--- @field orderPriority integer The calculated ordering priority value of the shader, that allows auto-sorting of shaders. Changing this value will re-sort the shader list.
--- @field variables table<string, string> Lists the shader's editable variables. The result table has the variable names as keys, and the variable types as values. To get and set the actual variable, use the expression `shaderHandle.<variableName>`.
--- 
--- Variable types are:
--- 
--- - 'b' boolean
--- - 'i' integer
--- - 'f' float
--- - 's' string
--- - 'a' float array
--- - '2' vec2
--- - '3' vec3
--- - '4' vec4
--- - 'm' matrix
