--- @meta
--- This modifer applies acceleration to particles in the parent niParticleSystemController.
--- @class niParticleBomb : niParticleModifier, niObject
--- @field decay number The niParticleBomb modifers with `decayType` linear and exponential have their strength attenuated with distance. No attenuation occurs within the `.decay` distance of the niParticelBomb's position.
--- @field decayType ni.particleBombDecayType Controls how the force applied attenuates with distance. Maps to values in [`ni.particleBombDecayType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ni/particle-bomb-decay-types/) table.
--- @field deltaV number The acceleration applied to the particles.
--- @field direction tes3vector3 The direction of applied acceleration used for cylindrical and planar particle bombs.
--- @field duration number Controls how long this modifer affects the particles.
--- @field position tes3vector3 This is the center of force that spherical and cylindrical particle bombs apply to the particles.
--- @field start number The time at which this modifier start affecting the particles.
--- @field symmetryType ni.particleBombSymmetryType Controls how this modifer affects the particles. Spherical modifer operates around the point defined by `.position` property. Cylindrical modifer applied the force parallel to the `.direction` vector, centered at `position` property. Planar modifers operate perpendicular to the `.direction` vector.
