--- @field isCumulative boolean *Read-only*. No description yet available.
--- @field isFirstFrame boolean *Read-only*. No description yet available.
--- @field lastTime number *Read-only*. The latest time delta used in the update method for all the controllers in this sequence.
--- @field manager niKeyframeManager *Read-only*. Access back to the parent keyframe manager.
--- @field name string *Read-only*. No description yet available.
--- @field offset number *Read-only*. The time offset is addded to the [lastTime](./niSequence.md#lasttime) to determine the time used for updating keyframe controllers.
